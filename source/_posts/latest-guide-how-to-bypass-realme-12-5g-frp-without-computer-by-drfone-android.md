The ****Realme 12 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 12 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme 12 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 12 5G device. In essence, the Realme 12 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
