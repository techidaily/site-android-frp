**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Poco X6  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Poco X6  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Poco X6 . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Poco X6 , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Poco X6 device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Poco FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

If you want to use your PC to bypass Poco FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called âSideSync apk.â Once it is installed, run and connect your Poco X6  with your PC by using a USB cable.

**Step 2:**

A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.

This will pop up in the settings menu, where you must choose the option of Backup and reset. Then select Factory data reset to rest your Poco device. Here you go, you have bypassed the FRP of your device.
