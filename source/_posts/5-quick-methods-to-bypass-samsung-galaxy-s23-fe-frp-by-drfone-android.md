## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Samsung?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Samsung smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Samsung. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

#### Pros

- Does not require any money
- The fastest and most straightforward process of bypassing
- No involvement of Google account or its credentials

#### Cons

- You need to download the file and install it on your PC

#### Limitations

The major limitation of this process is its dependency on a computer or laptop. Next, you won't be able to reboot your device until and unless you connect it to the PC through the USB cable. Some data can get lost due to the automatic reboot system.

**Tips:**

One of the best ways to bypass FRP lock is to disable it beforehand. To do so, go to your settings and click the accounts option. All the accounts like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Google will open up. Click on Google and remove all the saved and active Google accounts. This will automatically disable the FRP lock.
