FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Reno 8T 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Reno 8T 5G device.

### Purpose of Oppo Reno 8T 5G FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Reno 8T 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo Reno 8T 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
