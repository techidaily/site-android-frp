![bypass Honor V Purse frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor V Purse FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor V Purse by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor V Purse device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor V Purse device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor V Purse device.

### Purpose of Honor V Purse FRP

The primary purpose of Honor V Purse FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor V Purse device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor V Purse device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor V Purse device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor V Purse FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor V Purse device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor V Purse after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor V Purse device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Honor V Purse FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.
