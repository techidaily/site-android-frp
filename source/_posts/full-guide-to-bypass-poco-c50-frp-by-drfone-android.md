### What is Poco C50 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C50 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C50 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C50 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Poco C50 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C50 device being lost or stolen.
