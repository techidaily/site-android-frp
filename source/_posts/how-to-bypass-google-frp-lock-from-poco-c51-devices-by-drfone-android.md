## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco C51 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco C51 smartphones.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C51 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C51 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C51 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Poco C51 Phone?

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Poco C51 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Poco C51 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco C51 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Poco C51 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco C51:

![bypass Poco C51 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco C51 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C51 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C51 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C51 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco C51 device.

### Purpose of Poco C51 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco C51 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco C51 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C51 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco C51 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco C51 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco C51 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco C51 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco C51 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Poco C51 users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Poco C51:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Poco C51 and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Poco C51 device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Poco C51 device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

- **Step 3.** After pressing "Emergency," tap "Emergency Information" on the next screen. On the "Owner" screen, tap the icon at the top right corner, enter the SIM PIN code, and when asked, choose "Add contact."

- **Step 4.** Add the contact you saved as the owner's contact and make a call. During the call, tap "Contacts" to access your saved contacts, and select the one you saved. On tapping the three dots on the top, select "Share” and choose "Share as text."

- **Step 5.** Choose "XShare Mini" as the sharing option, grant the necessary permissions, and leave the Poco C51 device on the "QR Code." Move to another device and access a web browser. Go to mobileteamofficials.com and download two apps: “Google Account Manager” and “Account Login/ FRP Bypass.”

## Part 3: Poco C51 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Poco C51 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Poco C51 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Poco Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Choose “Permissions” and tap the “Search” icon at the top-right corner of the follow-up screen. Search for “Settings” and pick the respective app from the results list. Tap "Open" to access the Settings application. This action will direct you to the “Settings” interface.
