This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Nokia C12 Plus FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Nokia C12 Plus FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Nokia C12 Plus FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Nokia C12 Plus FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Nokia C12 Plus:

![bypass Nokia C12 Plus frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia C12 Plus FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia C12 Plus by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia C12 Plus device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia C12 Plus device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia C12 Plus device.

### Purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia C12 Plus device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia C12 Plus device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia C12 Plus device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia C12 Plus FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia C12 Plus device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia C12 Plus after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia C12 Plus device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Nokia C12 Plus FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Nokia Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 3: Nokia C12 Plus FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with.

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Nokia Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”
