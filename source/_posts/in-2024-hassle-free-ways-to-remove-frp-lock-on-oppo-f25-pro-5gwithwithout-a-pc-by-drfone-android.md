FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo F25 Pro 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device.
