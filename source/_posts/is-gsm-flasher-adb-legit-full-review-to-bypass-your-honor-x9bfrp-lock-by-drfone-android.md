## Part 1: What’s Honor X9b FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor X9b device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor X9b device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor X9b device.

The ****Honor X9b FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor X9b device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor X9b device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor X9b device. In essence, the Honor X9b FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor X9b device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor X9b device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor X9b FRP Code

To use the Honor X9b FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Honor customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Honor model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Honor smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Honor X9b device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor X9b device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Honor X9b FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Honor smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Honor X9b FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Honor X9b FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Honor phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Honor X9b FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Honor smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."

![tap on forgot password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/bypass-vivo-frp-without-computer-1.jpg)
