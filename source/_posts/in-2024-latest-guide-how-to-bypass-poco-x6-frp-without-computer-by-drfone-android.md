Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco X6 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Poco X6 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Poco X6 device.

The ****Poco X6 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco X6 device after it has been reset.

## Part 1: Understanding the Poco X6 FRP

![bypass Poco X6 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco X6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco X6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X6 device.

### Purpose of Poco X6 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco X6 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X6 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X6 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X6 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco X6 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco X6 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco X6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco X6 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### Method 3: Using Combination File

The third method on the list for Poco X6 FRP bypass is using a combination file. In this method, you will need to use a specialized tool to bypass the FRP lock by putting your Poco X6 phone into Recovery Mode. The detailed steps for this method are following:

- **Step 1:** Begin by downloading the [Poco FRP unlock tool](http://www.mediafire.com/file/73kkpacf53sw2au/VIVO_FRP_TOOL_V1.0_BY_TEAM_GD.rar/file) (**Password:** GADGETSDOCTOR) on your computer and extract it. Now run the .exe file from the extracted content to install it. Afterward, turn off your Poco X6 and put it into Recovery Mode.

- **Step 2:** To put Poco X6 into Recovery Mode, you will need to simultaneously press and hold the “Power” and “Volume Up” keys together. Hold these keys until you see Fastboot Mode on the screen. Here use the Volume keys to select Recovery Mode.
- **Step 3:** Within Recovery Mode, select "Advanced Options," and on the following screen, choose "Reboot with adb." Now wait for your phone to turn on and later connect it to the computer with FRP unlock tool installed.

Now repeat the process once again and wait for your Poco X6 to reboot. Once the rebooting process is completed, check to confirm if the FRP lock has been bypassed.
