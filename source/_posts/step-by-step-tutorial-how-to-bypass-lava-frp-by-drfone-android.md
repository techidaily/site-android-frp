## Part 1: Understanding the Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free.

![bypass Lava Blaze Curve 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Blaze Curve 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.

### Purpose of Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Lava Blaze Curve 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Lava Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Lava Blaze Curve 5G Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Lava Blaze Curve 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for **Lava Blaze Curve 5G Nord FRP bypass** solutions for seamless device access.

![google frp bypass in oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Lava Blaze Curve 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Lava Blaze Curve 5G Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Lava Blaze Curve 5G Phone

- Switch on the Wi-Fi network of the Lava Blaze Curve 5G phone and head to the 'Hello' screen.
- Take the following path:

_**Emergency Call> Emergency Rescue> Add Contact**_

![emergency rescue interface of oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-02.jpg)

- When the permission prompt pops up, click on 'Deny' and tap "Go to Settings".
- Hit the 'Permission' tab and tap the 'Search' button.
- Enter 'Settings' in the search field, choose the 'Settings App Info' option, and tap the 'Open' button.

_**System> Accessibility> Accessibility Menu> Toggle the Button to Turn it On> Allow> Got it**_

- Head to the "Settings" app and tap "Apps and Notifications". Next, click on "See All Apps".
- Find and disable the 'Android Setup' and 'Google Play Service' within the application list.

![disabling android setup and google play service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-03.jpg)

- Navigate back to the 'Hello' screen to completely disable the setup by taking the following path:

This is a quick and smart way to address the FRP lock removal issue within several minutes. Here's what you need to do:

- Use an OTG to connect the pen drive to the FRP-locked device.
- Head to the destination folder of the downloaded APK in the "File Manager" application.
- Install the APK in the FRP-locked phone by allowing the app permissions.
- Navigate to 'Settings' and enable the 'Install from Unknown Source' option.
- Reinstall and open the APK.

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Lava Blaze Curve 5G Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.

![launching the 'settings' application on oneplus phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-05.jpg)

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Lava Blaze Curve 5G phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
