## How To Bypass Meizu 21 Pro FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Meizu 21 Pro FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Meizu 21 Pro device and use the same Gmail account.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Meizu 21 Pro device again.
