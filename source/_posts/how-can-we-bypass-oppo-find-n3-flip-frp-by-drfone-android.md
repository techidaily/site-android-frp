## Ultimate Guide on Oppo Find N3 Flip FRP Bypass

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Oppo phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Oppo Find N3 Flip FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Oppo FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Oppo phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Oppo Find N3 Flip FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Oppo FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Oppo phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Oppo phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Oppo FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Oppo phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.
