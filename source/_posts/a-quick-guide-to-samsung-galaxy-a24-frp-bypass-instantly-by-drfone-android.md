In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Samsung Galaxy A24:

![bypass Samsung Galaxy A24 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A24 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A24 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy A24 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy A24 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy A24 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy A24 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 3: Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Samsung Galaxy A24 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Samsung Galaxy A24 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Samsung Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)
