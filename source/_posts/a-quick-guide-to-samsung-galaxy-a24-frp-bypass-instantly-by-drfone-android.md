This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Samsung Galaxy A24:

![bypass Samsung Galaxy A24 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A24 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A24 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy A24 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy A24 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy A24 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy A24 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Samsung Galaxy A24 Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Samsung Galaxy A24 users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Samsung Galaxy A24:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Samsung Galaxy A24 and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.

![add sim to tecno pop 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Samsung Galaxy A24 device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

![provide sim passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-5.jpg)

- **Step 3.** After pressing "Emergency," tap "Emergency Information" on the next screen. On the "Owner" screen, tap the icon at the top right corner, enter the SIM PIN code, and when asked, choose "Add contact."

![proceed to add contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-6.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Add the contact you saved as the owner's contact and make a call. During the call, tap "Contacts" to access your saved contacts, and select the one you saved. On tapping the three dots on the top, select "Share” and choose "Share as text."

![select and share saved contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-7.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Choose "XShare Mini" as the sharing option, grant the necessary permissions, and leave the Samsung Galaxy A24 device on the "QR Code." Move to another device and access a web browser. Go to mobileteamofficials.com and download two apps: “Google Account Manager” and “Account Login/ FRP Bypass.”

![download apps for frp unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-8.jpg)

- **Step 6.** On the other device you’re using, download the two apps from the Google Play Store: “Activity Launcher” and “XShare.” Now open the XShare app and grant all the required permissions. Tap "Receive" and scan the QR code from the Samsung device to complete the contact transfer process.
