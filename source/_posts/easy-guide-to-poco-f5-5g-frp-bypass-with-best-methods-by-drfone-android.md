#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Poco smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Poco F5 5G device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Poco F5 5G device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Poco F5 5G FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Poco smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Poco F5 5G FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Poco F5 5G FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Poco phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Poco F5 5G FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Poco smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."

- ****Step 2:**** Now, use the recovery phone number or email associated with your Google account to receive the verification code. Afterward, create a new password and wait for around 24 hours. Once Google has synced the new password across devices, you can sign in and bypass the FRP lock.
