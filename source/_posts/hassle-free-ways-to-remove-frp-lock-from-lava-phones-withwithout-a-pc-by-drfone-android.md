After a factory reset, the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.
