It is due to the Motorola G24 Power device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Motorola G24 Power. It is designed to safeguard the Motorola G24 Power device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Motorola G24 Power FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Motorola G24 Power FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Motorola G24 Power FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Motorola G24 Power FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Motorola G24 Power:

![bypass Motorola G24 Power frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Motorola G24 Power FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola G24 Power by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola G24 Power device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola G24 Power device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Motorola G24 Power device.

### Purpose of Motorola G24 Power FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola G24 Power FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola G24 Power device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Motorola G24 Power device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Motorola G24 Power device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Motorola G24 Power FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Motorola G24 Power device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Motorola G24 Power after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Motorola G24 Power device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
