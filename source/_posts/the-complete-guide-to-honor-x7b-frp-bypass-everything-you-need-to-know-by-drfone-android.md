## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor X7b device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor X7b device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X7b device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor X7b device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor X7b device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor X7b device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

**A simple list of solutions**

To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.

- Retrieve your Google account on another device
- Delete Google account from Settings
- Bypass Honor FRP through PC by using a USB Cable

## Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor X7b .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Honor FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Honor X7b  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Honor X7b  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Honor X7b  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor X7b . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor X7b , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Honor X7b device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

If you want to use your PC to bypass Honor FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor X7b  with your PC by using a USB cable.

**Step 2:**

A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.

![chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/realme-frp-bypass-1.jpg)
