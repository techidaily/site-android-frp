![bypass Samsung Galaxy A34 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy A34 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy A34 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy A34 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device.

FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Samsung Galaxy A34 5G FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.
