## Part 1: Understanding the Asus ROG Phone 7 FRP

### What is Asus ROG Phone 7 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Asus ROG Phone 7 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Asus ROG Phone 7 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Asus ROG Phone 7 device.

### Purpose of Asus ROG Phone 7 FRP

The primary purpose of Asus ROG Phone 7 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Asus ROG Phone 7 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Asus ROG Phone 7 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Asus ROG Phone 7 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Asus ROG Phone 7 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Asus ROG Phone 7 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Asus ROG Phone 7 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Asus ROG Phone 7 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Asus ROG Phone 7 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:
