#### 1\. Faulty USB Connection

 During the bypass process, your computer may fail to detect your Samsung device when connected via USB.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Samsung device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Samsung device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.

**Solution:** Attempt the process again by following the instructions meticulously. Double-check that you have entered the correct information and followed each step accurately.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass.
