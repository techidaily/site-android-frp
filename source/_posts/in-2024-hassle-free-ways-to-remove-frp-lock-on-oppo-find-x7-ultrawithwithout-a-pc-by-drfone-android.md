In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra:

![bypass Oppo Find X7 Ultra frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device.

### Purpose of Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo Find X7 Ultra after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Oppo Find X7 Ultra FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)

- Your Android device's FRP lock will be removed following the execution of the commands.

## Part 5: How To Disable FRP Oppo Find X7 Ultra?

Disabling FRP on Oppo Find X7 Ultra/Poco devices is relatively simple. Once you've removed the Google account from your device, the FRP lock will be disabled, and you'll no longer need to bypass **Oppo FRP**.

- Go to "Settings" from the menu.
- Go down the page and click "Accounts & Sync."

![disable frp step 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-21.jpg)

- To delete a Google account, tap on it.
