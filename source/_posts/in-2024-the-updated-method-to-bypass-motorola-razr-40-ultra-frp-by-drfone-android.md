## Part 3: Motorola Razr 40 Ultra FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with.

You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Motorola Razr 40 Ultra Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Motorola Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”
