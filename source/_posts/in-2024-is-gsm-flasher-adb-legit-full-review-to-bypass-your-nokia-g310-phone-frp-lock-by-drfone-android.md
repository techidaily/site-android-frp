## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Nokia G310 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Nokia G310 device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Nokia G310 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Nokia G310 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for **Nokia G310 Nord FRP bypass** solutions for seamless device access.

![google frp bypass in oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Nokia G310 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Nokia G310 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Nokia G310 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Nokia G310 Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Nokia G310 device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Nokia G310 Phone

- Take the following path:

_**Emergency Call> Emergency Rescue> Add Contact**_

![emergency rescue interface of oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-02.jpg)

### 2\. Using FRP Bypass APK

This is a quick and smart way to address the FRP lock removal issue within several minutes. Here's what you need to do:

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Nokia G310 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Nokia G310 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Nokia G310 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock.
