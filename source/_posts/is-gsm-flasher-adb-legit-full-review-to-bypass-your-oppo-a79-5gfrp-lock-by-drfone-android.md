![bypass Oppo A79 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo A79 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo A79 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo A79 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo A79 5G device to the user's Google account.
