Before going after **Meizu FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Meizu frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Meizu 21 Pro device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Meizu 21 Pro device.

After a factory reset, the Meizu 21 Pro device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Meizu 21 Pro device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Meizu 21 Pro device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Meizu 21 Pro device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Meizu FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Meizu smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Meizu before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Meizu 21 Pro device. While using your Meizu with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Meizu 21 Pro device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Meizu device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Meizu smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

 During the bypass process, your computer may fail to detect your Meizu device when connected via USB.

**Solution:** Ensure your Meizu device is properly connected to your computer via a USB cable. Moreover, try using a different laptop port or USB cable but confirm it is original to fix any connection-related issues.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Meizu device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Meizu device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.

#### 3\. Retry Bypass Methods

The bypass method you have chosen may not be successful in bypassing FRP on your device.

**Solution:** Attempt the process again by following the instructions meticulously. Double-check that you have entered the correct information and followed each step accurately.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass. If not, try switching to a different network, such as taking a mobile hotspot from your family member or friend. You can also reset your network settings if connectivity issues persist.

### General Tips for a Successful FRP Bypass Process

To increase the likelihood of a successful FRP bypass on your Meizu device, consider the following general tips:

#### 1\. Research and Understand the Method

Familiarize yourself with the Viva Y20 FRP bypass Android 12 method you intend to use. Read tutorials, watch videos, and gather information. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the instructions involved for your selected methods to perform successfully.

#### 2\. Ensure Device Compatibility

Verify that the FRP bypass method or tool you plan to use is compatible with your specific Meizu device. It should be compatible with the model and the Android version it is running. Using incompatible methods can lead to errors and unsuccessful bypass attempts.

Pay close attention to each step of the **Meizu FRP bypass Android 13** process. Follow the instructions precisely. At times even a minor mistake can hinder the success of the bypass.
