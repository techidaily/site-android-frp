### What is Samsung Galaxy S23+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy S23+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device to the user's Google account.
