The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device.

After a factory reset, the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device.
