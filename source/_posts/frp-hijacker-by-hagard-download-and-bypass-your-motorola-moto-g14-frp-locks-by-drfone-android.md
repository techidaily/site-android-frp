First, download and install the Dr.Fone app on your Laptop or PC. Then, follow the instructions given below:

**Step 1:** Launch Dr.Fone, and connect your Android device (We are taking Samsung as an example) via a USB cable or wireless connection. Once the Motorola Moto G14 device is connected, click **“Toolbox”** \> "**Screen Unlock**" to open options on the new window.

![Select Screen Unlock from the menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** You will see two options on your screen. Select "**Android**" and continue. Then, select "**Remove Google FRP Lock**" and proceed.

![Select Remove Google FRP Lock from the options.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png)

**Step 3:** Now you will see options for multiple Android phone brands. We are removing the FRP lock of the Samsung phone. So, we will select Samsung and click the "**Start**" button.

**Step 4:** Now, select the Android OS version of your phone and click the "**Start** " button. However, if you are not sure about the Android version, you can select the "**All Android Version (One-Click Removal)** " option.

![Select the Android version of your smartphone.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-google-frp-unknown-os-4.png)

**Step 5:** Here, you have to follow the on-screen instructions. Find the " **Emergency Call** " button on your Android and click it. Type **#0#** to open a secret menu. Then, click the "**Next** " button on your computer screen.

**Step 6:** You will see a pop-up on your phone's screen to activate USB debugging. After allowing it on your device, click " **Authorized**" on your Dr.Fone screen.

**Step 7:** Dr.Fone will start removing the FRP lock from your Samsung device. Once the process is completed, you will see the interface shown below. You can check your device. If it's successful, you can click "**Done.**" Otherwise, you can try again.

![Once the process is completed, click Done.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-google-frp-on-samsung.png)

Did you see how easy it is to **bypass the FRP lock** with the help of Dr.Fone? There is no need to manually perform complex steps. Just a few clicks and you are done. However, if you still want to continue with the AddROM Samsung, you must consider some factors.

## Part 6. Factors to Consider Before Using AddROM

Here are some factors that you should consider before using **AddRombypass**:

- Using **AddROM APK** may void your device's warranty. It can impact future support from the manufacturer.
- Bypassing the FRP lock screen with this tool could risk your data and privacy. It can expose your data to vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of legal restrictions surrounding the use of **AddROM**. Make sure it is allowed in your jurisdiction to avoid legal consequences.
- Successfully using AddROM requires technical knowledge. Improper use may lead to device malfunction or data loss.
- Research feedback from other users who have used this tool to bypass FRP locks. It can help you to understand potential risks and benefits.
- Before using **AddROM**, ensure you have backed up important data on your device. It will help you to prevent loss during the unlocking process.

## Conclusion

We all know that FRP locks can be annoying and cause you trouble. But thankfully, there are different ways available to bypass it. We hope you successfully removed the FRP lock and regained access to your Android phone.

Using AddROM FRP bypass is indeed a complex and time-consuming method. Some users couldn't even follow all the steps and left the process in the middle.
