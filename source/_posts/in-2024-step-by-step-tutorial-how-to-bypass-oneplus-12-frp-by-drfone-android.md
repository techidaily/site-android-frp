The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the OnePlus 12. It is designed to safeguard the OnePlus 12 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **OnePlus 12 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the OnePlus 12 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly OnePlus 12 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **OnePlus 12 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the OnePlus 12:

![bypass OnePlus 12 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus 12 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus 12 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus 12 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus 12 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus 12 device.

### Purpose of OnePlus 12 FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus 12 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus 12 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus 12 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus 12 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus 12 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus 12 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus 12 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus 12 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing OnePlus 12 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **OnePlus Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your OnePlus 12 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

## How To Bypass OnePlus 12 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing OnePlus 12 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many OnePlus 12 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your OnePlus 12 device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the OnePlus 12 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing OnePlus 12 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass OnePlus 12 FRP

OnePlus 12 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the OnePlus 12 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the OnePlus 12 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass OnePlus 12 FRP With 3 Easy Methods

Bypassing FRP can be a bit tricky, but it's possible to do it if you have the right tools and know-how. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to bypass FRP on your OnePlus 12 device, below are the methods you can use to OnePlus 12 Hot 10 FRP bypass.

### Method #1: Recover the Google Account Of Your Device

Performing a Factory Reset requires restoring a Google account. It is advisable to recover your email ID or password from another device before attempting OnePlus 12 Hot 8 FRP bypass.

You can solve the problem if you have an alternate email address or phone number associated with the account you want to recover. By inserting a verification code, you can easily change the password for your Google account.

After resetting your password, it will take 24 to 72 hours to sync the new password with all devices registered to the account.

Once synced, you can perform a factory data reset by providing an email and a new password. Following this method, you can factory reset your OnePlus 12 Hot S without bypassing FRP.

However, if you provide the wrong password in this process, the time will restart for the next 24-72 hours to sync.

So, be careful when entering your email and password on the OnePlus 12 device.
