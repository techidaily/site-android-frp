## Part 3: Honor X50i+ FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Honor X50i+ Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Honor X50i+ Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Honor Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”
