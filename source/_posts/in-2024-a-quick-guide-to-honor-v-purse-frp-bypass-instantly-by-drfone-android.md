### What is Honor V Purse FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor V Purse by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor V Purse device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor V Purse device to the user's Google account.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Honor before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Honor V Purse device. While using your Honor with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Honor V Purse device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Honor device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Honor smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

- **Step 2:** To verify your identity, utilize the phone number or recovery email associated with your Google account. You will receive a verification code on the phone number or recovery email. Once received, enter the code provided.

- **Step 3:** After completing the verification process, you can create a new password for your Google account. Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Honor smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.
