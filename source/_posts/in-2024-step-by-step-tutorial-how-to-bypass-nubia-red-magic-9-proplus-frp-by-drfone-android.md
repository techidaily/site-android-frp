![bypass Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device.

### Purpose of Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ FRP

The primary purpose of Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
