This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Huawei P60 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Huawei P60 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Huawei P60 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Huawei P60 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Huawei P60:

![bypass Huawei P60 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Huawei P60 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Huawei P60 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Huawei P60 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Huawei P60 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Huawei P60 device.

### Purpose of Huawei P60 FRP

The primary purpose of Huawei P60 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Huawei P60 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Huawei P60 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Huawei P60 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Huawei P60 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Huawei P60 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Huawei P60 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Huawei P60 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Huawei P60 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Huawei Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Huawei P60 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Huawei P60 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Huawei P60 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Huawei P60 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Huawei P60 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Huawei P60 to your computer.
