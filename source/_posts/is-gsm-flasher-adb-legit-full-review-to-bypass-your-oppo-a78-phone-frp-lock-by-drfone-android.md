### What is Oppo A78 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo A78 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo A78 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo A78 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Oppo A78 FRP
