## Part 1: What’s Poco C50 FRP Code and How To Use It

Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco C50 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Poco C50 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Poco C50 device.

The ****Poco C50 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco C50 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Poco C50 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Poco C50 device. In essence, the Poco C50 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Poco device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup
