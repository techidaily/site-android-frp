## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.

### The Bottom Line

This **Poco C50  FRP bypass** article gives an insight into the methods you can use to remove the FRP lock. However, if you have a other Android brand phone, the best one of all methods is using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/). It delivers solutions for those who don't know the OS variant of their phone. Its interface is easy to understand and has clear instructions. Moreover, bypassing the FRP lock is just a matter of a few minutes for it.
