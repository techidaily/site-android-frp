The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Lava Blaze 2 5G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Lava Blaze 2 5G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Lava Blaze 2 5G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Lava Blaze 2 5G device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Lava Blaze 2 5G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

Go to mobileteamofficials.com and download two apps: “Google Account Manager” and “Account Login/ FRP Bypass.”

## Part 3: Lava Blaze 2 5G FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with.

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Lava Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”
