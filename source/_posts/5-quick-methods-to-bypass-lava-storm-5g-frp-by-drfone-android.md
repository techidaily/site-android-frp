### What is Lava Storm 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Storm 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Storm 5G device.

### Purpose of Lava Storm 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Storm 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Storm 5G device.
