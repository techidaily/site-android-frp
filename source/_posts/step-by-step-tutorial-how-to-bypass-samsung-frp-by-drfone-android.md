## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free.

### What is Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP

## Part 3: Samsung Galaxy M14 4G FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with.

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Samsung Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”
