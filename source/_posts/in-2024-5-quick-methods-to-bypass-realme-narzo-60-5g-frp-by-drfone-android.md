While the software solution is the best option for **Realme Narzo 60 5G Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Realme Narzo 60 5G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Realme Narzo 60 5G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Realme Narzo 60 5G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Realme Narzo 60 5G device.
