![what is Motorola frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device.

After a factory reset, the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

First, verify that your Motorola smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

While using your Motorola with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone â Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

## Part 3: Limitations of Using ADB and Fastboot Command Method

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
