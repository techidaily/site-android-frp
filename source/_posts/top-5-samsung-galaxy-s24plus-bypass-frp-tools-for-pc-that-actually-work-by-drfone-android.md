**Solution:** Ensure your Samsung device is properly connected to your computer via a USB cable. Moreover, try using a different laptop port or USB cable but confirm it is original to fix any connection-related issues.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Samsung device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Samsung device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.

#### 3\. Retry Bypass Methods

The bypass method you have chosen may not be successful in bypassing FRP on your device.

**Solution:** Attempt the process again by following the instructions meticulously. Double-check that you have entered the correct information and followed each step accurately.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass. If not, try switching to a different network, such as taking a mobile hotspot from your family member or friend. You can also reset your network settings if connectivity issues persist.
