Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
