Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Meizu 21 Pro smartphones.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Meizu 21 Pro device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Meizu 21 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Meizu 21 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Meizu 21 Pro device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Meizu 21 Pro device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Meizu 21 Pro FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.
