Are you having trouble bypassing Oppo F23 5G FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Oppo F23 5G device and use the same Gmail account.
