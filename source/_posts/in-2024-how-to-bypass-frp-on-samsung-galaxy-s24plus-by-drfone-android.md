## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Samsung Galaxy S24+:

![bypass Samsung Galaxy S24+ frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy S24+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Samsung Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.

Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Samsung Galaxy S24+ to your computer.

During the process, it's crucial to keep your device connected to the computer and refrain from disconnecting it until the bypass is complete. After the firmware download is finished, Dr.Fone will initiate the FRP lock bypass process. Once completed, your Samsung device will restart, and you'll regain access to it without encountering the FRP lock.
