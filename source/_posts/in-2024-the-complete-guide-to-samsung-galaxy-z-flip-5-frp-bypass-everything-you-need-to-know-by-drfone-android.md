### What is Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 device.
