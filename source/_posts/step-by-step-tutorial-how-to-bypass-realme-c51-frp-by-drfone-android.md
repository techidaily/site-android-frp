### What is Realme C51 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme C51 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme C51 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme C51 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Realme C51 FRP

The primary purpose of Realme C51 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme C51 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme C51 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme C51 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme C51 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme C51 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme C51 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme C51 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme C51 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Realme Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Realme C51 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment
