## Part 2: Definition of Honor Play 8T  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Play 8T device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Play 8T device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Play 8T phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.
