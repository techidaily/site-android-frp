**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Meizu 21 Pro  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Meizu 21 Pro  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Meizu 21 Pro . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Meizu 21 Pro , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Meizu 21 Pro device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Meizu FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**
