### What is Oppo A18 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo A18 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo A18 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo A18 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Oppo A18 FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo A18 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo A18 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo A18 device being lost or stolen.

If you remove the Google account from the Oppo A18 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo A18 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
