## Part 1: Understanding the OnePlus Open FRP

![bypass OnePlus Open frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus Open FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Open by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Open device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Open device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Open device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Open FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus Open FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus Open device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Open device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus Open device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus Open FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus Open device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus Open after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus Open device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing OnePlus Open FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **OnePlus Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your OnePlus Open is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass OnePlus Open FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your OnePlus Open to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your OnePlus Open to your computer.
