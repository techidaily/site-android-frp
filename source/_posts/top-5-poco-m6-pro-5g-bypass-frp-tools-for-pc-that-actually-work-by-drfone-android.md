## Part 1: What’s Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco M6 Pro 5G device after it has been reset.
