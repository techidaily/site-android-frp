## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco X6 Pro Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco X6 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes.

![google frp bypass in oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco X6 Pro device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco X6 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco X6 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Poco X6 Pro Phone?

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco X6 Pro device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco X6 Pro device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.
