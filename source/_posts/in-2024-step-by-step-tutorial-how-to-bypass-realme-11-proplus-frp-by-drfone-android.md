## Part 1: Understanding the Realme 11 Pro+ FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme 11 Pro+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Realme 11 Pro+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme 11 Pro+:

![bypass Realme 11 Pro+ frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme 11 Pro+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 11 Pro+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 11 Pro+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 11 Pro+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme 11 Pro+ device.

### Purpose of Realme 11 Pro+ FRP

The primary purpose of Realme 11 Pro+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme 11 Pro+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme 11 Pro+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme 11 Pro+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme 11 Pro+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme 11 Pro+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme 11 Pro+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme 11 Pro+ FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Realme Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro+ device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.
