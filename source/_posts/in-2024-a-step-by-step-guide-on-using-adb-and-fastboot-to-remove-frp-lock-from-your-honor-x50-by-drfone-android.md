## Ultimate Guide on Honor X50 FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Honor phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Honor X50 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Honor FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor X50 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Honor FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._
