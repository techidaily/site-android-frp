Having a clear understanding of what exactly Oppo A56s 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Oppo A56s 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Oppo A56s 5G:

![bypass Oppo A56s 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo A56s 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo A56s 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo A56s 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo A56s 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo A56s 5G device.

### Purpose of Oppo A56s 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo A56s 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo A56s 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo A56s 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo A56s 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Oppo A56s 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Oppo A56s 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo A56s 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Oppo A56s 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Oppo A56s 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Oppo FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Oppo phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Oppo A56s 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Oppo FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Oppo phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Oppo phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection.

Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Oppo phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Oppo Android 11 without PC

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on Oppo A56s 5G** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows Oppo users to bypass FRP on any Oppo brand. It's straightforward; this app lets you create another Google Account on your locked Oppo phone without unlocking it. In short, you'll link a new Google Account with a password that you can easily remember.

#### TechnoCare APK Features

- Install custom ROMs on Oppo.
- No registration is required.
- No age restrictions to use.
- User-friendly and quick FRP unlock.

- **Step 1:** Start by enabling the Talkback feature on your phone. To do that, tap the Home key three times consecutively on the welcome screen.
- **Step 2:** Now go to the Talkback Menu and then open Talkback Settings. Then, click the Search icon and enter “Getting started with Talkback.”
- **Step 3:** Play the video on the “Getting Started” screen. Then, tap the three dots before clicking the Share > Google Plus icon.
- **Step 4:** YouTube will open where you'll tap “Terms and Privacy Policy” to open the Google browser. Here, click Bookmarks and then tap History.
- **Step 5:** The Download History will open with File Manager, where you'll click My Files and then choose SD card.

- **Step 9:** Open the downloaded TechnoCare FRP APK and install the Technocare app. After installing it, tap Next and then tap Settings > Accounts. Now choose Add account to add another Google Account.
- **Step 10:** Go to Device Administrator and enable Android Device Manager.
- **Step 11:** Navigate back to Settings, click Apps, and enable Google Play Services and Google Account Manager.
- **Step 12:** Lastly, restart the locked phone and enjoy the services.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Oppo Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Oppo, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Oppo

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Oppo Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Oppo and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
