![bypass Nokia G310 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia G310 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia G310 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia G310 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia G310 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia G310 device.

The primary purpose of Nokia G310 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia G310 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia G310 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia G310 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

If you remove the Google account from the Nokia G310 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia G310 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia G310 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
