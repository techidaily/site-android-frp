![bypass Lava Yuva 3 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Lava Yuva 3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Yuva 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Yuva 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Yuva 3 device to the user's Google account.

The primary purpose of Lava Yuva 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Yuva 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Lava Yuva 3 device being lost or stolen.
