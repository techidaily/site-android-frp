### What is Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

### Purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP

The primary purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device.
