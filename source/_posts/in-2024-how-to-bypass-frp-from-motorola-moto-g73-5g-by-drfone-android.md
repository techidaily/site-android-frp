![bypass Motorola Moto G73 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola Moto G73 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola Moto G73 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola Moto G73 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Motorola Moto G73 5G device.

### Purpose of Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola Moto G73 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Motorola Moto G73 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Motorola Moto G73 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Motorola Moto G73 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Motorola Moto G73 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Motorola Moto G73 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Motorola Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Motorola Moto G73 5G is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Motorola Moto G73 5G to your computer.
