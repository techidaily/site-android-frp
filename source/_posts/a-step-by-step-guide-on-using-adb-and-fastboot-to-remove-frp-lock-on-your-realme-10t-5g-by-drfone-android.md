## Part 1: Quick Overview of ADB and Fastboot Commands

### 1\. What are ADB and Fastboot?

Standing for Android Debug Bridge, ADB and Fastboots are the methods through which communication with an Android device can be done through a computer. Under this method, the commands and the actions that are sent from the system are performed on your Android device.

Several issues can be resolved, and multiple functions can be performed using the **ADB format tool** and Fastboots, and this also includes removing the FRP lock on your Android device. To use this method, USB debugging should be enabled on the Realme 10T 5G device.

For specific brands of Android phones, specific utility tools are available like the **Vivo ADB format tool** and the **Samsung ADB format tool**, which are used explicitly for Vivo and Samsung phones, respectively.

### 2\. How Do ADB and Fastboot Bypass FRP?

Using the versatile ADB command-line tool and Fastboots, the Google FRP lock can be removed using several commands depending on the OS version. This is a client-server program that includes a client who sends the commands, a daemon used to run the commands on the Realme 10T 5G device, and a server that facilitates communication between the client and the daemon.

ADB comes included in the Android SDK Platform-Tools package, and this can be downloaded using the SDK manager.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.

## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme 10T 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

![reset android phone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg)

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme 10T 5G device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

## Part 5: Is Pangu FRP Bypass the Best FRP Removal Tool for You?

**Pangu FRP bypass tool** is free and works on older Android versions. But there are reasons to consider other options. Let's explore them.

Technical Knowledge Required

It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you're not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It's not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

## Part 1: Understanding the Realme 10T 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme 10T 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Realme 10T 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme 10T 5G:

![bypass Realme 10T 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme 10T 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 10T 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 10T 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 10T 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme 10T 5G device.

### Purpose of Realme 10T 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Realme 10T 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme 10T 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme 10T 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme 10T 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme 10T 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme 10T 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme 10T 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme 10T 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
