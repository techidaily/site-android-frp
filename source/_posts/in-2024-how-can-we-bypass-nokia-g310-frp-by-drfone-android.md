## Part 3: Nokia G310 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Nokia G310 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Nokia G310 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Nokia Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)
