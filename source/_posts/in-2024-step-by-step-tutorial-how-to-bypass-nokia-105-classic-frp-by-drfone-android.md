## Part 1: Understanding the Nokia 105 Classic FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Nokia 105 Classic FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Nokia 105 Classic FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Nokia 105 Classic:

![bypass Nokia 105 Classic frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia 105 Classic FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia 105 Classic by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia 105 Classic device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia 105 Classic device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia 105 Classic device.

### Purpose of Nokia 105 Classic FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia 105 Classic FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia 105 Classic device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia 105 Classic device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia 105 Classic device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia 105 Classic FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia 105 Classic device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia 105 Classic after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia 105 Classic device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
