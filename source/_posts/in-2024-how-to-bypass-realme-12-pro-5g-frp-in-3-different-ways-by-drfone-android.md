## Part 2: How To Bypass Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Realme phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Realme smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."

- ****Step 2:**** Now, use the recovery phone number or email associated with your Google account to receive the verification code. Afterward, create a new password and wait for around 24 hours. Once Google has synced the new password across devices, you can sign in and bypass the FRP lock.
