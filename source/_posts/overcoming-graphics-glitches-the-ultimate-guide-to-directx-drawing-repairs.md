### Method 1: Add Sea of Thieves into your antivirus file exclusions

3. Copy the content which looks like this:  
**`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.SeaofThieves_2.78.5523.2_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe`**
4. Open the Trend Micro main console by right-clicking on the Trend Micro icon in your taskbar, and then select **Open the Main Console.**
5. Open the**Settings** menu.
6. Select **Exception Lists** , and then **Program/folders.**
7. Select the**+** button, and then **Browse.**
8. Paste Step 3 file addree into the File name box.
9. Select the **Open** button. This will add the path to your Exception List.
10. Select **OK** to save your changes and close the Exception List window.

### Method 2: Lower the graphics settings in the game

 It is possible that the game can be crashed because your graphics card cannot capable of the high settings in the game. So if you’re using an old graphics card, you can try to lower the graphics setting in the game to fix the problem.

### Method 3: Update your driver

 The outdated or missing driver can cause game crashing. You have to make sure your drivers have been updated and install correctly.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update button** next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
