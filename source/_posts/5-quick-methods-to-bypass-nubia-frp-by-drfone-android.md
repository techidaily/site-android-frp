## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Nubia?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Nubia smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Nubia. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

### 1\. Reset all your settings in Safe Mode

One of the easiest and most basic ways of bypassing the FRP lock is by enabling the safe mode on your mobile and proceeding with a factory reset of all the settings. This will erase the data, especially the current Google account, which is incorporated within the phone. Once everything is related, the settings will be restored to their original form or the default value. This will allow you to have unhindered access to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device, as the FRP lock will get disabled due to settings reset.
