![bypass Motorola Edge 40 Neo frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Motorola Edge 40 Neo FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola Edge 40 Neo by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device.

### Purpose of Motorola Edge 40 Neo FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola Edge 40 Neo FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Motorola Edge 40 Neo FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Motorola Edge 40 Neo after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
