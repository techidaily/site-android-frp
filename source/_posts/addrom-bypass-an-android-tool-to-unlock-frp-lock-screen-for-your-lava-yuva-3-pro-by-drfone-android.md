### What is Lava Yuva 3 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Yuva 3 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device to the user's Google account.
