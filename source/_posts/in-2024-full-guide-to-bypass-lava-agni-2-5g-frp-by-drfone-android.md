### What is Lava Agni 2 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Agni 2 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Agni 2 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Agni 2 5G device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Agni 2 5G device.
