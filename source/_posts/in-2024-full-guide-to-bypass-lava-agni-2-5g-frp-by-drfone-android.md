### What is Lava Agni 2 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Agni 2 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Agni 2 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Agni 2 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Lava Agni 2 5G device.

### Purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Agni 2 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Lava Agni 2 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Lava Agni 2 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
