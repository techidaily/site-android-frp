![what is Oppo frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Oppo A78 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Oppo A78 5G device.

After a factory reset, the Oppo A78 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Oppo A78 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Oppo A78 5G device.

This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Oppo before backing up your data.
