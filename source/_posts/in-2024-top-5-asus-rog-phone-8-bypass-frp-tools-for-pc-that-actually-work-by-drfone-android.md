The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Asus ROG Phone 8 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Asus ROG Phone 8 device.

After a factory reset, the Asus ROG Phone 8 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Asus ROG Phone 8 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Asus ROG Phone 8 device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Asus before backing up your data.
