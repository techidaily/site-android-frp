FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.
