To regain full access to the Nokia G22 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Nokia G22 device.

The ****Nokia G22 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Nokia G22 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Nokia G22 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Nokia G22 device.
