### What is Realme GT 5 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme GT 5 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT 5 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT 5 device to the user's Google account.
