### What is Realme GT 5 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme GT 5 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT 5 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT 5 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme GT 5 device.

### Purpose of Realme GT 5 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme GT 5 device being lost or stolen.
