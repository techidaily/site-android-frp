![bypass Honor Magic 6 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic 6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic 6 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 6 device being lost or stolen.
