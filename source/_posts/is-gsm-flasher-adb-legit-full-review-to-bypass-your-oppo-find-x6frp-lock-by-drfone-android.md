Did you see how easy it is to **bypass the FRP lock** with the help of Dr.Fone? There is no need to manually perform complex steps. Just a few clicks and you are done. However, if you still want to continue with the AddROM Samsung, you must consider some factors.

## Part 6. Factors to Consider Before Using AddROM

Here are some factors that you should consider before using **AddRombypass**:

- Using **AddROM APK** may void your device's warranty. It can impact future support from the manufacturer.
- Bypassing the FRP lock screen with this tool could risk your data and privacy. It can expose your data to vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of legal restrictions surrounding the use of **AddROM**. Make sure it is allowed in your jurisdiction to avoid legal consequences.
- Successfully using AddROM requires technical knowledge. Improper use may lead to device malfunction or data loss.
- Research feedback from other users who have used this tool to bypass FRP locks. It can help you to understand potential risks and benefits.

## Conclusion

We all know that FRP locks can be annoying and cause you trouble. But thankfully, there are different ways available to bypass it. We hope you successfully removed the FRP lock and regained access to your Android phone.

Using AddROM FRP bypass is indeed a complex and time-consuming method. Some users couldn't even follow all the steps and left the process in the middle.
