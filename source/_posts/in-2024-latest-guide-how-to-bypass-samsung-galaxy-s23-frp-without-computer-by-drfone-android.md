### What is Samsung Galaxy S23 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy S23 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy S23 device.

## Part 2: Definition of Samsung Galaxy S23  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
