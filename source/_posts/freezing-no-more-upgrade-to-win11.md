Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the right drivers for your exact video card, and your version of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly.

 If the above methods don’t work, go check your**Task Manager** for clues on which applications could be at fault. If they’re occupying a lot of disk usage, it’s worth looking into. When you locate any suspicious applications, right-click them and click End Task to see if the mouse lagging problem is resolved.

## **Other options**

 1)**Disable Cortana** . Many users have reported that disabling Cortana helped fix their freezing mouse.

 2)**Disable ATI HotKey Poller service** . Many users have also reported that ATI Catalyst drivers including an ATI HotKey Poller service can cause mouse lag in certain system configurations. If you don’t need the ATI hotkeys, just disable this service.

Here’s how you can do it:

 a) Press the **Windows key** and**R** at the same time, type**services.msc** in, and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c21ca77a670.png)

 b) Locate**ATI HotKey Poller** service on the right side of the window. Then double-click it.

 c) You’ll be in the Properties window. Change the**Startup type** to**Disabled** . Then click**Apply** and**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c21d89cc8e7.jpg)

d) Restart your computer.

 3)**Don’t use USB hubs to connect your mouse** . Directly connect your mouse and keyboard to your computer via the ports at the back of your PC to ensure you get the best performance.

 4) Try to temporarily **disconnect other USB peripherals** , such as a digital camera, USB disk drive, and so on. This will help you confirm whether this problem is caused by device conflicts.

 We hope this helps resolve your problem. If you have any questions, please leave us a comment below.
