These included built-in Oppo tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Oppo smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Oppo A59 5G FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Oppo A59 5G FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
