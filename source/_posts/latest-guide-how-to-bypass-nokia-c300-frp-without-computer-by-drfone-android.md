## Part 1: What’s Nokia C300 FRP Code and How To Use It

Nokia smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Nokia C300 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Nokia C300 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Nokia C300 device, it acts as an extra layer of security.
