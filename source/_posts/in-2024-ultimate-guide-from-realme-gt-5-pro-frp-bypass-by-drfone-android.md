## Ultimate Guide on Realme GT 5 Pro FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Realme phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Realme GT 5 Pro FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Realme FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme GT 5 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Realme FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Realme GT 5 Pro FRP

Realme GT 5 Pro devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Realme GT 5 Pro device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme GT 5 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme GT 5 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Realme GT 5 Pro device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Realme GT 5 Pro phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
