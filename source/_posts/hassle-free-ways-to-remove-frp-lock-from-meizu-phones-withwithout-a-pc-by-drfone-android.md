## Part 1: Understanding the Meizu 21 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Meizu 21 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Meizu 21 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Meizu 21 Pro:

![bypass Meizu 21 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Meizu 21 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Meizu 21 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Meizu 21 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Meizu 21 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Meizu 21 Pro device.

### Purpose of Meizu 21 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Meizu 21 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Meizu 21 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Meizu 21 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Meizu 21 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Meizu 21 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Meizu 21 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Meizu 21 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
