### What is OnePlus Ace 2 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Ace 2 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Ace 2 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Ace 2 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Ace 2 device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus Ace 2 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Ace 2 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus Ace 2 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus Ace 2 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus Ace 2 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus Ace 2 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
