### What is OnePlus Nord 3 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Nord 3 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device to the user's Google account.
