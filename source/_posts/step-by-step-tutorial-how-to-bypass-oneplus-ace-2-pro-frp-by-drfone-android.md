## Part 1: Understanding the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro:

![bypass OnePlus Ace 2 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Devices

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

## Part 5. FRP Hijacker by Hagard or Wondershare Dr.Fone: Which Is Better?

Now faced with the choice between **FRP Hijacker by Hagard** and Wondershare Dr.Fone, it becomes important to determine which tool aligns best with your specific requirements. Both options promise FRP bypass capabilities, yet they differ in their costs, ease of use, compatibility, and security measures.

Let's delve deeper into each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

|  | **Hijacker by Hagard** | **Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward | Intuitive design with a guided process |
| Security Measures | Using vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to bypass FRP | High encryption and protection measures during the FRP unlocking process |
| Compatibility | Primarily for Samsung devices | Compatible with a wide range of Android and iOS devices. |
| Cost | Generally free | Paid software with a free trial |
| Support and Updates | Limited support; updates may vary | Strong customer support; regular updates |

## Conclusion

**FRP Hijacker by Hagard** presents itself as a targeted solution, particularly effective for Samsung devices. Its simplicity and specialized approach make it an appealing option for users who prioritize ease of use and have Samsung smartphones. However, it's important to note that its effectiveness is confined to Samsung devices, and users should consider this limitation when making a decision.

For those using Android devices other than Samsung or desiring a more versatile solution, Dr.Fone's Screen Unlock tool proves effective and easy to use. Just pick the one that matches your device and preferences for a smooth FRP unlocking experience.
