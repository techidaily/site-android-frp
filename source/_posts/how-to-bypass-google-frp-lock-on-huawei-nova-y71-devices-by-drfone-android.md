## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Huawei Nova Y71 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Huawei Nova Y71 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Huawei Nova Y71 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Huawei Nova Y71 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Huawei Nova Y71 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Huawei Nova Y71 Phone?

![bypass Huawei Nova Y71 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Huawei Nova Y71 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Huawei Nova Y71 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Huawei Nova Y71 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Huawei Nova Y71 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Huawei Nova Y71 device.

### Purpose of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP

The primary purpose of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Huawei Nova Y71 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Huawei Nova Y71 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Huawei Nova Y71 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.
