![bypass OnePlus Ace 2 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus Ace 2 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Ace 2 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Ace 2 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Ace 2 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Ace 2 device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Ace 2 device being lost or stolen.
