## How To Bypass Meizu 21 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Meizu 21 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Meizu 21 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Meizu 21 device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Meizu 21 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Meizu 21 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Meizu 21 FRP

Meizu 21 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Meizu 21 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Meizu 21 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass Meizu 21 FRP With 3 Easy Methods

Bypassing FRP can be a bit tricky, but it's possible to do it if you have the right tools and know-how. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to bypass FRP on your Meizu 21 device, below are the methods you can use to Meizu 21 Hot 10 FRP bypass.

### Method #1: Recover the Google Account Of Your Device

Performing a Factory Reset requires restoring a Google account. It is advisable to recover your email ID or password from another device before attempting Meizu 21 Hot 8 FRP bypass.

You can solve the problem if you have an alternate email address or phone number associated with the account you want to recover. By inserting a verification code, you can easily change the password for your Google account.

After resetting your password, it will take 24 to 72 hours to sync the new password with all devices registered to the account.

Once synced, you can perform a factory data reset by providing an email and a new password. Following this method, you can factory reset your Meizu 21 Hot S without bypassing FRP.

However, if you provide the wrong password in this process, the time will restart for the next 24-72 hours to sync.

So, be careful when entering your email and password on the Meizu 21 device.

### Method #2: Bypass Meizu 21 FRP With FRP Bypass APK

Meizu 21 Hot 8 FRP bypass is done using FRP Bypass APK, an Android application. FRP Bypass APK will prove helpful if you cannot retrieve your Google account, which is logged into your Meizu 21 smart 5 FRP bypass.

The APK lets you remove the Google account verification process without a password. You can use this method for free, safely, and quickly.

If you use FRP Bypass APK, you can bypass FRP lock on Meizu 21 Hot 10 FRP bypass and any Android phone running version 5.1 or higher.
