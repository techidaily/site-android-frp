Lava smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device after it has been reset.
