## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11X 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11X 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11X 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

![bypass Realme 11X 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme 11X 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 11X 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 11X 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 11X 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme 11X 5G device.

### Purpose of Realme 11X 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Realme 11X 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme 11X 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme 11X 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme 11X 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
