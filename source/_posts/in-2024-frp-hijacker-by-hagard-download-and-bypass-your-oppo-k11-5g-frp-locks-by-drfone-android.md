Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Search for the Settings app and open it.
- **Step 2:** Next, click Accounts and backup before clicking Accounts.
- **Step 3:** You'll see all the linked email accounts. Choose the one that you want to delete.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and then click Remove Account once again to confirm. That's it!

## Conclusion

See, you can quickly bypass FRP on Oppo K11 5G with these methods. But remember that disabling FRP will leave your phone without security protection.
