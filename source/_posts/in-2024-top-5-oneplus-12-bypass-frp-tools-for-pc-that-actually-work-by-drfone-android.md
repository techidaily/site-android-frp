It is designed to safeguard the OnePlus 12 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **OnePlus 12 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the OnePlus 12 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly OnePlus 12 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **OnePlus 12 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the OnePlus 12:

![bypass OnePlus 12 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus 12 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus 12 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus 12 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus 12 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus 12 device.

### Purpose of OnePlus 12 FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus 12 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus 12 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus 12 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus 12 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus 12 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus 12 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus 12 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus 12 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **OnePlus Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment
