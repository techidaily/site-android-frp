It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:
