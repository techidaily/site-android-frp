Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Realme 11 5G .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Realme FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.
