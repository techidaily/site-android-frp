## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

![reset android phone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg)

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

Limited Customer Support

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.
