## Ultimate Guide on Samsung Galaxy M54 5G FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Samsung phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Samsung Galaxy M54 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Samsung FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Samsung phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Samsung Galaxy M54 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Samsung FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Samsung phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Samsung phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Samsung FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Samsung phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 3: Limitations of Using ADB and Fastboot Command Method

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
