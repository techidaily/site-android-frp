We discussed the Realme C33 2023 FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Realme tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Realme smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Realme C33 2023 FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Realme C33 2023 FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.

## How Can We Bypass Realme C33 2023 FRP?

After you hard reset your Realme smartphone, you must open the FRP lock before using it. If you can't pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the **Realme FRP** lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don't know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Realme FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Realme .

## Part 1: What is Realme FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn't allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the **Realme FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English **Realme FRP** **code** is \*#813#, and the Chinese code is \*#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.

When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That's where you will be entering the **Realme FRP bypass code**. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.
