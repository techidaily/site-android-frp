### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device.

After a factory reset, the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Asus before backing up your data.

A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device.

After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
