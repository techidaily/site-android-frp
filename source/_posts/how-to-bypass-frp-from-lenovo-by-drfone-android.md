## Part 1: What’s Lenovo ThinkPhone FRP Code and How To Use It

Lenovo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Lenovo ThinkPhone device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Lenovo ThinkPhone device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Lenovo ThinkPhone device.

The ****Lenovo ThinkPhone FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Lenovo ThinkPhone device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Lenovo ThinkPhone device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Lenovo ThinkPhone device. In essence, the Lenovo ThinkPhone FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Lenovo ThinkPhone device, providing additional protection. Each [Lenovo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Lenovo ThinkPhone device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Lenovo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup
