## Part 1: What’s Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco M6 Pro 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Poco M6 Pro 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Poco M6 Pro 5G device.

The ****Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco M6 Pro 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Poco M6 Pro 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Poco M6 Pro 5G device. In essence, the Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Poco M6 Pro 5G device, providing additional protection.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Poco M6 Pro 5G device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
