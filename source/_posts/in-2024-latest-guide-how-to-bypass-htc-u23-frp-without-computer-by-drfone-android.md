## Part 1: What’s HTC U23 FRP Code and How To Use It

HTC smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the HTC U23 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the HTC U23 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the HTC U23 device.

The ****HTC U23 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the HTC U23 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the HTC U23 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the HTC U23 device. In essence, the HTC U23 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the HTC U23 device, providing additional protection. Each [HTC device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html)possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the HTC U23 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:
