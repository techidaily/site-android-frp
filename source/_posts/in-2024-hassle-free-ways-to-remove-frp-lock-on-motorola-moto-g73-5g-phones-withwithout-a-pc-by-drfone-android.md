### What is Motorola Moto G73 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola Moto G73 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola Moto G73 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola Moto G73 5G device to the user's Google account.
