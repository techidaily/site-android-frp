One of the easiest and most basic ways of bypassing the FRP lock is by enabling the safe mode on your mobile and proceeding with a factory reset of all the settings. This will erase the data, especially the current Google account, which is incorporated within the phone. Once everything is related, the settings will be restored to their original form or the default value. This will allow you to have unhindered access to the Samsung Galaxy S24 device, as the FRP lock will get disabled due to settings reset.
