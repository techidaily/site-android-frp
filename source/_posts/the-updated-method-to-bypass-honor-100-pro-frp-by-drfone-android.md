Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Honor 100 Pro devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.
