## Part 1: What’s Realme 11 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Realme 11 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 11 Pro device after it has been reset.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme 11 Pro device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.
