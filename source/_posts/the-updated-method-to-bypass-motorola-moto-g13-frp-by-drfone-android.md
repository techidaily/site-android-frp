### What is Motorola Moto G13 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

### Purpose of Motorola Moto G13 FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola Moto G13 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola Moto G13 device.
