### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Poco X6 Pro device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Poco X6 Pro device.

After a factory reset, the Poco X6 Pro device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Poco X6 Pro device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Poco X6 Pro device.

It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Poco device to at least 50%.
