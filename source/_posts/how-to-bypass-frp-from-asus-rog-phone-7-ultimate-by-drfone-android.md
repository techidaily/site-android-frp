But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

**Step 4:** Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner and select "Terms & Privacy Policies."

**Step 5:** After clicking Terms & Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type "**addrom.com/bypass,**" scroll down, and then download the relevant "**Google Account Manager** " (GAM) APK.
