### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Huawei Nova Y91 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Huawei Nova Y91 device.

After a factory reset, the Huawei Nova Y91 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Huawei Nova Y91 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Huawei Nova Y91 device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.
