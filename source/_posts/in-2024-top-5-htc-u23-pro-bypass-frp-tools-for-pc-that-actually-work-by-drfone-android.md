At this point, the HTC U23 Pro device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

Apart from the ****HTC U23 Pro FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within HTC phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass HTC U23 Pro FRP:
