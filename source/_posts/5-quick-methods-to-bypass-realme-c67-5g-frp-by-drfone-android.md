## Part 1: In what cases does the Realme C67 5G FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Realme C67 5G FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Realme

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Realme phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Realme C67 5G FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Realme phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Realme C67 5G FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Realme from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.

**FRP Hijacker by Hagard** presents itself as a targeted solution, particularly effective for Samsung devices. Its simplicity and specialized approach make it an appealing option for users who prioritize ease of use and have Samsung smartphones. However, it's important to note that its effectiveness is confined to Samsung devices, and users should consider this limitation when making a decision.

For those using Android devices other than Samsung or desiring a more versatile solution, Dr.Fone's Screen Unlock tool proves effective and easy to use. Just pick the one that matches your device and preferences for a smooth FRP unlocking experience.

_**Tips:** Are you searching for a powerful FRP Unlock tool? No worries as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is here to help you. Download it and start a seamless unlock experience!_
