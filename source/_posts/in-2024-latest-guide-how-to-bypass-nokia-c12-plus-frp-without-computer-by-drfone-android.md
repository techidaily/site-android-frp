![bypass Nokia C12 Plus frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia C12 Plus FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia C12 Plus by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia C12 Plus device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia C12 Plus device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia C12 Plus device.

### Purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia C12 Plus device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia C12 Plus device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia C12 Plus device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia C12 Plus FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia C12 Plus device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia C12 Plus after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
