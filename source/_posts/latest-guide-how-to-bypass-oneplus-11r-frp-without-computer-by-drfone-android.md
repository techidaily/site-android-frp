![bypass OnePlus 11R frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus 11R FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus 11R by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus 11R device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus 11R device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus 11R device.

### Purpose of OnePlus 11R FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus 11R FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus 11R device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus 11R device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus 11R device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus 11R FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus 11R device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus 11R after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
