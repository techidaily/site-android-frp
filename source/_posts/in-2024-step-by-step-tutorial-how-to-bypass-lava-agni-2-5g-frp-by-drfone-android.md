## Part 1: Understanding the Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Lava Agni 2 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Lava Agni 2 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Lava Agni 2 5G:

![bypass Lava Agni 2 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Lava Agni 2 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Agni 2 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Agni 2 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Agni 2 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Lava Agni 2 5G device.

### Purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Agni 2 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Lava Agni 2 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Lava Agni 2 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Lava Agni 2 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Lava Agni 2 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Lava Agni 2 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Lava Agni 2 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Lava Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
