## Part 1: Understanding the Nokia C12 Plus FRP

![bypass Nokia C12 Plus frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia C12 Plus FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia C12 Plus by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia C12 Plus device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia C12 Plus device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia C12 Plus device.

### Purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia C12 Plus FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia C12 Plus device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia C12 Plus device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia C12 Plus device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

## Part 3: Nokia C12 Plus FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Nokia C12 Plus Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Nokia C12 Plus Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Nokia Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.
