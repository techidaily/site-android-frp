## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme C51 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

![reset android phone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg)

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme C51 device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

Limited Customer Support

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn't guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn't work on your device.

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Realme C51 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Realme C51 device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Realme C51. It is designed to safeguard the Realme C51 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Realme C51 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Realme C51 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme C51 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Realme C51 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme C51:

![bypass Realme C51 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme C51 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme C51 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme C51 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme C51 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme C51 device.

### Purpose of Realme C51 FRP

The primary purpose of Realme C51 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme C51 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme C51 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme C51 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme C51 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme C51 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme C51 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme C51 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme C51 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Realme Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Realme C51 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Realme C51 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Realme C51 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Realme C51 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Realme C51 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Realme C51 to your computer.
