## Easy Guide How To Bypass Realme 11 Pro+ FRP Android 10/11/12/13

Security measures have become increasingly robust nowadays to protect user data. One such security feature is Factory Reset Protection (FRP). This feature is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset. FRP serves its purpose of safeguarding personal information. At times it can pose a challenge for users who find themselves locked out of their own devices.

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step **Realme FRP bypass Android 10, 11**, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you'll regain access to your Realme smartphone even if you've forgotten the associated Google account credentials.

## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Realme FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Realme frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Realme 11 Pro+ device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Realme 11 Pro+ device.

After a factory reset, the Realme 11 Pro+ device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Realme 11 Pro+ device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Realme 11 Pro+ device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Realme 11 Pro+ device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Realme FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Realme smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Realme before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Realme 11 Pro+ device. While using your Realme with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Realme 11 Pro+ device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Realme device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Realme smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password.
