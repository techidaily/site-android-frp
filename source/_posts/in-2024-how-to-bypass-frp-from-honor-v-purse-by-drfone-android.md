### 1\. What are ADB and Fastboot?

Standing for Android Debug Bridge, ADB and Fastboots are the methods through which communication with an Android device can be done through a computer. Under this method, the commands and the actions that are sent from the system are performed on your Android device.

Several issues can be resolved, and multiple functions can be performed using the **ADB format tool** and Fastboots, and this also includes removing the FRP lock on your Android device. To use this method, USB debugging should be enabled on the Honor V Purse device.

For specific brands of Android phones, specific utility tools are available like the **Vivo ADB format tool** and the **Samsung ADB format tool**, which are used explicitly for Vivo and Samsung phones, respectively.

### 2\. How Do ADB and Fastboot Bypass FRP?

Using the versatile ADB command-line tool and Fastboots, the Google FRP lock can be removed using several commands depending on the OS version.
