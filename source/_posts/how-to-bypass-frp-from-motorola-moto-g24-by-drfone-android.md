![bypass Motorola Moto G24 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Motorola Moto G24 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola Moto G24 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola Moto G24 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola Moto G24 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Motorola Moto G24 device.

### Purpose of Motorola Moto G24 FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola Moto G24 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola Moto G24 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Motorola Moto G24 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Motorola Moto G24 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Motorola Moto G24 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Motorola Moto G24 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Motorola Moto G24 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
