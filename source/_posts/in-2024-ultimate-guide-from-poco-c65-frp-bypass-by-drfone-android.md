## Ultimate Guide on Poco C65 FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Poco phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Poco C65 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Poco FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Poco phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco C65 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Poco FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 1: What’s Poco C65 FRP Code and How To Use It

Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco C65 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Poco C65 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Poco C65 device.

The ****Poco C65 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco C65 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Poco C65 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Poco C65 device. In essence, the Poco C65 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Poco C65 device, providing additional protection. Each [Poco device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Poco C65 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Poco smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Poco smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Poco C65 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Poco C65 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Poco C65 FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Poco smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.
