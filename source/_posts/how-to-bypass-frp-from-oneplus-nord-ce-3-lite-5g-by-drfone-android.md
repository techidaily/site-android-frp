Using AddROM FRP bypass is indeed a complex and time-consuming method. Some users couldn't even follow all the steps and left the process in the middle. Whereas, Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is an easy and reliable alternative.

The best thing about this tool is it is not just limited to FRP bypass. There are many other features, such as data recovery, data manager, system cleaner, etc, offered by [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).
