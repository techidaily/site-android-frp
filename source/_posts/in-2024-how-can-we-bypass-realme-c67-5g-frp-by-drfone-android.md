## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme C67 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme C67 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
