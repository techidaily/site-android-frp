### What is Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device.

### Purpose of Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Oppo phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Oppo FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Oppo phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Oppo phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Oppo FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Oppo phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
