### What is Oppo Find X7 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Find X7 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Find X7 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Find X7 device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Oppo Find X7 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Find X7 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo Find X7 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

## Part 2: Definition of Oppo Find X7  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
