### What is Huawei Nova Y71 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Huawei Nova Y71 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Huawei Nova Y71 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Huawei Nova Y71 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Huawei Nova Y71 device.

### Purpose of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP

The primary purpose of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Huawei Nova Y71 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Huawei Nova Y71 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Huawei Nova Y71 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Huawei Nova Y71 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Huawei Nova Y71 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Huawei Nova Y71 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Huawei Nova Y71 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Huawei Nova Y71 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Huawei Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
