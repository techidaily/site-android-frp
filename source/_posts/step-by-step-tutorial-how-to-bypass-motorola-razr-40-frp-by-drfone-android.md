This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Motorola Razr 40 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Motorola Razr 40 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Motorola Razr 40 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Motorola Razr 40 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Motorola Razr 40:

![bypass Motorola Razr 40 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Motorola Razr 40 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Motorola Razr 40 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Motorola Razr 40 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Motorola Razr 40 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Motorola Razr 40 device.

### Purpose of Motorola Razr 40 FRP

The primary purpose of Motorola Razr 40 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Motorola Razr 40 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Motorola Razr 40 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Motorola Razr 40 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Motorola Razr 40 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Motorola Razr 40 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Motorola Razr 40 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Motorola Razr 40 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Motorola Razr 40 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Motorola Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Motorola Razr 40 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Motorola Razr 40 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Motorola Razr 40 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Motorola Razr 40 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 2\. Using FRP Bypass APK

This is a quick and smart way to address the FRP lock removal issue within several minutes. Here's what you need to do:

- Download the FRP Bypass APK to a PC or some other smartphone from the latter's official website, followed by copying it into a pen drive.
- Use an OTG to connect the pen drive to the FRP-locked device.
- Head to the destination folder of the downloaded APK in the "File Manager" application.
- Install the APK in the FRP-locked phone by allowing the app permissions.
- Navigate to 'Settings' and enable the 'Install from Unknown Source' option.
- Reinstall and open the APK.
- The 'Settings' menu will pop up. Head to the "Backup and Reset" option.

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Motorola Razr 40 Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Motorola Razr 40 device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Motorola Razr 40 device.

![launching the 'settings' application on oneplus phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-05.jpg)

- In the app's opening interface, click on the 'Accounts' tab to open the section.

- A list of all the accounts linked to your Motorola Razr 40 device will be displayed. Tap on the desired Gmail account to unlink it from your phone.

![google account selection for quick removal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-07.jpg)

- A confirmation prompt will pop up to ensure a willful deletion of the account from the Motorola Razr 40 device. Tap on 'Remove Account' to confirm the action. This will cause all data linked with the account to get deleted from the phone.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Motorola Razr 40 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Motorola Razr 40 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Motorola Razr 40 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Motorola Razr 40 phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
