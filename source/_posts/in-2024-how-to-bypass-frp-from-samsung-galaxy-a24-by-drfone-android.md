As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy A24 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### What is Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A24 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A24 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy A24 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy A24 device being lost or stolen.
