As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
