To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Poco X6 Pro device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
