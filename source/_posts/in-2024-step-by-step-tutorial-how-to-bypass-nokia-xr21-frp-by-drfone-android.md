Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Nokia XR21 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Nokia XR21 device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Nokia XR21. It is designed to safeguard the Nokia XR21 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Nokia XR21 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Nokia XR21 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Nokia XR21 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Nokia XR21 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Nokia XR21:

![bypass Nokia XR21 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia XR21 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia XR21 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia XR21 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia XR21 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia XR21 device.

### Purpose of Nokia XR21 FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia XR21 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia XR21 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia XR21 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia XR21 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia XR21 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia XR21 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia XR21 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia XR21 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Nokia XR21 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Nokia Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Nokia XR21 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Nokia XR21 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment
