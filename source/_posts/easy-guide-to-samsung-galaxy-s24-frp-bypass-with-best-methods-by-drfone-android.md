While the software solution is the best option for **Samsung Galaxy S24 Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

### What is Samsung Galaxy S24 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy S24 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy S24 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy S24 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy S24 device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy S24 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy S24 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy S24 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

To bypass Samsung Galaxy S24 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Samsung Galaxy S24 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Samsung Galaxy S24 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Samsung Galaxy S24 to your computer.

### 4\. Ensure a Stable Internet Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is vital for a smooth FRP bypass. Make sure your computer and Samsung Galaxy S24 are connected to the internet throughout the process. FRP bypassing will need you to download related files to complete the procedure.
