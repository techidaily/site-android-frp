![bypass Poco M6 Pro 4G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco M6 Pro 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco M6 Pro 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.

### Purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco M6 Pro 4G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco M6 Pro 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
