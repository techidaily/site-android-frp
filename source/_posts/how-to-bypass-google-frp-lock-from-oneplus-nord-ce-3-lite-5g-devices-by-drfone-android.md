## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

## Part 3: Limitations of Using ADB and Fastboot Command Method

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
