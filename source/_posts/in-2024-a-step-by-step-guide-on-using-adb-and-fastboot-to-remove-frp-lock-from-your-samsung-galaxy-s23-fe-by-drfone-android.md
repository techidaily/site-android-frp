## Part 1: What’s Samsung Galaxy S23 FE FRP Code and How To Use It

Samsung smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device.

The ****Samsung Galaxy S23 FE FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device after it has been reset.
