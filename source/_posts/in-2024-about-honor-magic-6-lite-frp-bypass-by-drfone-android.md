## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

The feature also protects the Honor Magic 6 Lite device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 Lite phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Honor tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Honor smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations.
