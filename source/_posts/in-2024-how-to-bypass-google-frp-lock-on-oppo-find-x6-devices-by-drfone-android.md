## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Oppo Find X6 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Oppo Find X6 smartphones.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Oppo Find X6 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Oppo Find X6 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Oppo Find X6 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Oppo Find X6 Phone?

![bypass Oppo Find X6 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo Find X6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Find X6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Find X6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Find X6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo Find X6 device.

### Purpose of Oppo Find X6 FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Find X6 device being lost or stolen.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo Find X6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
