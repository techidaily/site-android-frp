FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Poco F5 Pro 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Poco F5 Pro 5G FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)
