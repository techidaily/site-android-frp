## Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme GT 3 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Realme FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 1: What’s Realme GT 3 FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Realme GT 3 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Realme GT 3 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Realme GT 3 device.

The ****Realme GT 3 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme GT 3 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme GT 3 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme GT 3 device. In essence, the Realme GT 3 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Realme GT 3 device, providing additional protection. Each [Realme device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Realme GT 3 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Realme smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Realme GT 3 FRP Code

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Realme GT 3 FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Realme GT 3 FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Realme phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Realme GT 3 FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account
