### 2\. How Do ADB and Fastboot Bypass FRP?

Using the versatile ADB command-line tool and Fastboots, the Google FRP lock can be removed using several commands depending on the OS version.

![bypass Nokia C300 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia C300 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia C300 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia C300 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia C300 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia C300 device.

### Purpose of Nokia C300 FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia C300 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia C300 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia C300 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia C300 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia C300 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia C300 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia C300 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia C300 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
