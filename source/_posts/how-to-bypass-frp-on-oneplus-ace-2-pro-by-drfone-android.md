![bypass OnePlus Ace 2 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP

OnePlus Ace 2 Pro devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass OnePlus Ace 2 Pro FRP With 3 Easy Methods

Bypassing FRP can be a bit tricky, but it's possible to do it if you have the right tools and know-how. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to bypass FRP on your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device, below are the methods you can use to OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Hot 10 FRP bypass.

After resetting your password, it will take 24 to 72 hours to sync the new password with all devices registered to the account.

Once synced, you can perform a factory data reset by providing an email and a new password. Following this method, you can factory reset your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Hot S without bypassing FRP.

However, if you provide the wrong password in this process, the time will restart for the next 24-72 hours to sync.

So, be careful when entering your email and password on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device.
