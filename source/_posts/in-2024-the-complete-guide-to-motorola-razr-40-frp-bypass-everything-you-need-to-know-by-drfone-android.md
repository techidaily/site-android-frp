## The Updated Method to Bypass Motorola Razr 40 FRP

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Motorola uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Motorola Razr 40 device would be able to access the Motorola Razr 40 device. This aids in preventing the Motorola Razr 40 device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device.
