## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C55 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C55 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C55 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Poco C55 Phone?

In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Poco C55 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Poco C55 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco C55 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Poco C55 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco C55:

![bypass Poco C55 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco C55 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C55 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C55 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C55 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco C55 device.

### Purpose of Poco C55 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco C55 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco C55 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C55 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco C55 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco C55 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco C55 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco C55 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco C55 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
