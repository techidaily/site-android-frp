### What is Oppo Reno 11F 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Reno 11F 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Reno 11F 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Reno 11F 5G device to the user's Google account.
