## Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme GT 3 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Realme FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## How to Bypass FRP on Realme GT 3?

Learning how to **FRP bypass on Realme GT 3** is vital in many ways. For instance, you might want to hard reset your phone to clear data and remove a bug or virus. Or, you may want to remove every bit of information before gifting or selling the phone. Whichever the case, learning how to bypass FRP on Realme GT 3 is a cakewalk with this 3-minute read. We'll know how to do that with or without a PC.

## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Realme GT 3 on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Realme GT 3 device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Realme GT 3 devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Realme GT 3 without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Realme GT 3, including via YouTube.

Below are the quick steps for Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus:

### Step 1: Dial an emergency number and save it

- 1\. Fire up your locked phone and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.
- 2\. Navigate back to the “Let's go” screen and tap Emergency call. Dial and call 112.
- 3\. Go back to the “Let's go” screen and click Next until you reach the Wi-Fi connection screen. Here, tap Add network and then click the Settings icon on the Samsung keyboard.
- 4\. Click Keyboard layout and feedback > Key-tap feedback. Then, choose Sound and vibration on the Tip section.
- 5\. Next, click Answering and ending calls > Answer automatically. Now enable the toggle before using your two fingers to select “10 seconds” and “Customize.” You'll see a pop-up dialog where you'll click App Info > Call settings > Block numbers.

![block numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/how-bypass-frp-on-android-9-1.jpg)

- 10\. Click any link on the video description to launch Google Chrome. Search, download, and install Apex Launcher APK from frpfile.com.
- 11\. After installing Apex Launcher, open it and then click Settings > Biometrics and security > Other security settings > Device admin apps > Find my Device > Deactivate.
