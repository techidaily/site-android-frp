### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Realme

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Realme phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Realme 12 5G FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Realme phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Realme 12 5G FRP bypass.

**Step 6:** You will see a pop-up on your phone's screen to activate USB debugging. After allowing it on your device, click " **Authorized**" on your Dr.Fone screen.

- Be aware of legal restrictions surrounding the use of **AddROM**. Make sure it is allowed in your jurisdiction to avoid legal consequences.
