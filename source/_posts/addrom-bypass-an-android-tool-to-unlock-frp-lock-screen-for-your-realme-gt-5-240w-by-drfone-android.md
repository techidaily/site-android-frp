Are you an Android user? Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.

Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don't know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.

However, in most cases, users don't remember their Google ID and password. This is where ****AddROM** Bypass** steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.
