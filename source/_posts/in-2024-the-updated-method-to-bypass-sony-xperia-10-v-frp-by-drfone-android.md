![bypass Sony Xperia 10 V frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Sony Xperia 10 V FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Sony Xperia 10 V by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Sony Xperia 10 V device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Sony Xperia 10 V device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Sony Xperia 10 V device.

### Purpose of Sony Xperia 10 V FRP

The primary purpose of Sony Xperia 10 V FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Sony Xperia 10 V device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Sony Xperia 10 V device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Sony Xperia 10 V device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Sony Xperia 10 V FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Sony Xperia 10 V device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled.
