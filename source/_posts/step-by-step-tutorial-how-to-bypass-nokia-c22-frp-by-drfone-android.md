It is designed to safeguard the Nokia C22 device from unauthorized access.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Nokia C22 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Nokia C22 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Nokia C22 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Nokia C22 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Nokia C22:

![bypass Nokia C22 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nokia C22 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nokia C22 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nokia C22 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nokia C22 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nokia C22 device.

### Purpose of Nokia C22 FRP

The primary purpose of Nokia C22 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nokia C22 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nokia C22 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nokia C22 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nokia C22 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nokia C22 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nokia C22 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nokia C22 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Nokia C22 FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Nokia C22 Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Nokia C22 users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Nokia C22:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Nokia C22 and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Nokia C22 device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Nokia C22 device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
