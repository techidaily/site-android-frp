## Part 1: Understanding the Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco M6 Pro 5G:

![bypass Poco M6 Pro 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco M6 Pro 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco M6 Pro 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco M6 Pro 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco M6 Pro 5G device.

### Purpose of Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco M6 Pro 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco M6 Pro 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco M6 Pro 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco M6 Pro 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco M6 Pro 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco M6 Pro 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Poco M6 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Poco M6 Pro 5G Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Poco M6 Pro 5G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Poco M6 Pro 5G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Poco M6 Pro 5G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Poco M6 Pro 5G device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Poco M6 Pro 5G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
