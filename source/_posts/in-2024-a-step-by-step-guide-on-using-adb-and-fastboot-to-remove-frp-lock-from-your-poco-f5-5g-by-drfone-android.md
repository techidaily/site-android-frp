## Ultimate Guide on Poco F5 5G FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Poco phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Poco F5 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Poco FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Poco phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco F5 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Poco FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Poco F5 5G device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Poco F5 5G device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
