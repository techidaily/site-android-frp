## Part 1: What’s Honor 100 FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 100 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 100 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 100 device.

The ****Honor 100 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 100 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 100 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 100 device. In essence, the Honor 100 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor 100 device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor 100 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor 100 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
