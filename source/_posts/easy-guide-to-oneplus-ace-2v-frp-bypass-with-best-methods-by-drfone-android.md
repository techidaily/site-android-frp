In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **OnePlus Ace 2V FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the OnePlus Ace 2V FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly OnePlus Ace 2V FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **OnePlus Ace 2V FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the OnePlus Ace 2V:

![bypass OnePlus Ace 2V frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is OnePlus Ace 2V FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Ace 2V by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Ace 2V device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Ace 2V device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Ace 2V device.

### Purpose of OnePlus Ace 2V FRP

The primary purpose of OnePlus Ace 2V FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the OnePlus Ace 2V device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the OnePlus Ace 2V device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the OnePlus Ace 2V device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of OnePlus Ace 2V FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the OnePlus Ace 2V device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your OnePlus Ace 2V after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the OnePlus Ace 2V device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### How it works?

Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you'll need your phone's Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we'll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

**A simple list of solutions**

To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.

- Retrieve your Google account on another device
- Delete Google account from Settings
- Bypass OnePlus FRP through PC by using a USB Cable

## Solutions to Bypass OnePlus FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing OnePlus Ace 2V .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **OnePlus FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your OnePlus Ace 2V  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the OnePlus Ace 2V  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this OnePlus Ace 2V  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the OnePlus Ace 2V . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the OnePlus Ace 2V , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the OnePlus Ace 2V device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass OnePlus FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

If you want to use your PC to bypass OnePlus FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your OnePlus Ace 2V  with your PC by using a USB cable.

**Step 2:**

A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.
