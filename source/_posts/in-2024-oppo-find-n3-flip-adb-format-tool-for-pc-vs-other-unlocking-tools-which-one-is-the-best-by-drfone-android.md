The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Oppo Find N3 Flip device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Oppo Find N3 Flip device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access.
