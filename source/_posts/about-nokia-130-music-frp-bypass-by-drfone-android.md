After a factory reset, the Nokia 130 Music device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Nokia 130 Music device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Nokia 130 Music device.

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Nokia FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process.

First, verify that your Nokia smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection.
