### What is Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro FRP

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
