This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Realme GT Neo 5 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Realme GT Neo 5 FRP

![bypass Realme GT Neo 5 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme GT Neo 5 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme GT Neo 5 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT Neo 5 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT Neo 5 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme GT Neo 5 device.

### Purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 FRP

The primary purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme GT Neo 5 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme GT Neo 5 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme GT Neo 5 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme GT Neo 5 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme GT Neo 5 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme GT Neo 5 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme GT Neo 5 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
