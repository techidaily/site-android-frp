This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Oppo A38 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Oppo A38 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Oppo A38 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Oppo A38 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Oppo A38:

![bypass Oppo A38 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo A38 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo A38 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo A38 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo A38 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo A38 device.

### Purpose of Oppo A38 FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo A38 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo A38 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo A38 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo A38 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Oppo A38 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Oppo A38 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo A38 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Oppo A38 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Oppo A38 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Oppo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.
