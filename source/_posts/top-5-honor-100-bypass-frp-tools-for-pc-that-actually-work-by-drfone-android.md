The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor 100 .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Honor FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.
