Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free.

![bypass Samsung Galaxy A14 4G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Samsung Galaxy A14 4G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Samsung Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Samsung FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Samsung phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Samsung phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge.

Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Samsung phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

The feature also protects the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
