## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Realme

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Realme phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Realme phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Realme from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.
