## Ultimate Guide on Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Samsung phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Samsung FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Samsung phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Samsung FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Samsung phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Samsung phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Samsung FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Samsung phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Samsung Galaxy S24+:

![bypass Samsung Galaxy S24+ frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy S24+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.
