## Part 1: Understanding the Oppo Find N3 FRP

![bypass Oppo Find N3 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Oppo Find N3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Oppo Find N3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Oppo Find N3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Oppo Find N3 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Oppo Find N3 device.

### Purpose of Oppo Find N3 FRP

The primary purpose of Oppo Find N3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Oppo Find N3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Oppo Find N3 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Oppo Find N3 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Oppo Find N3 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Oppo Find N3 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Oppo Find N3 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Oppo Find N3 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
