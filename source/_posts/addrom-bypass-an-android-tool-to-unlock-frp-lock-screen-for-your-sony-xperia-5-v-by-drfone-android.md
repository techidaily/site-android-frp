### What is Sony Xperia 5 V FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Sony Xperia 5 V by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Sony Xperia 5 V device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Sony Xperia 5 V device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Sony Xperia 5 V FRP

The primary purpose of Sony Xperia 5 V FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Sony Xperia 5 V device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Sony Xperia 5 V device being lost or stolen.
