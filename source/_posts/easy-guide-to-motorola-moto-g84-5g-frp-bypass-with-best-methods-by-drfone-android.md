**Step 5:** Here, you have to follow the on-screen instructions. Find the " **Emergency Call** " button on your Android and click it. Type **#0#** to open a secret menu. Then, click the "**Next** " button on your computer screen.

**Step 6:** You will see a pop-up on your phone's screen to activate USB debugging. After allowing it on your device, click " **Authorized**" on your Dr.Fone screen.

**Step 7:** Dr.Fone will start removing the FRP lock from your Samsung device. Once the process is completed, you will see the interface shown below. You can check your device. If it's successful, you can click "**Done.**" Otherwise, you can try again.

![Once the process is completed, click Done.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-google-frp-on-samsung.png)

Did you see how easy it is to **bypass the FRP lock** with the help of Dr.Fone? There is no need to manually perform complex steps. Just a few clicks and you are done. However, if you still want to continue with the AddROM Samsung, you must consider some factors.
