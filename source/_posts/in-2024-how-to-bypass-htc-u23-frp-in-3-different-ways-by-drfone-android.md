## How To Bypass HTC U23 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing HTC U23 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many HTC U23 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your HTC U23 device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the HTC U23 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing HTC U23 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass HTC U23 FRP

HTC U23 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the HTC U23 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
