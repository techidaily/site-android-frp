### Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 Updating your graphics driver can fix the issue most of the time, and it’s no harm to your PC but brings better performance.

You can update the graphics driver manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

Visit the website of your GPU manufacturer and search for your GPU model.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Choose the latest driver that’s compatible with your operating system. Then download and install it.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
