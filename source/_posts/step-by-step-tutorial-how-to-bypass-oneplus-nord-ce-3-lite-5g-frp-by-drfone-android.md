### What is OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device.
