![bypass Lava Blaze 2 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Lava Blaze 2 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Lava Blaze 2 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Lava Blaze 2 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Lava Blaze 2 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Lava Blaze 2 device.

### Purpose of Lava Blaze 2 FRP

The primary purpose of Lava Blaze 2 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Lava Blaze 2 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Lava Blaze 2 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Lava Blaze 2 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Lava Blaze 2 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Lava Blaze 2 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Lava Blaze 2 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Lava Blaze 2 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
