### What is Sony Xperia 10 V FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Sony Xperia 10 V by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Sony Xperia 10 V device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Sony Xperia 10 V device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Sony Xperia 10 V device.

### Purpose of Sony Xperia 10 V FRP

The primary purpose of Sony Xperia 10 V FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Sony Xperia 10 V device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Sony Xperia 10 V device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Sony Xperia 10 V device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Sony Xperia 10 V Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Sony Xperia 10 V device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Sony Xperia 10 V device.

- In the app's opening interface, click on the 'Accounts' tab to open the section.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Sony Xperia 10 V device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Sony Xperia 10 V device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Sony Xperia 10 V device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Sony Xperia 10 V phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
