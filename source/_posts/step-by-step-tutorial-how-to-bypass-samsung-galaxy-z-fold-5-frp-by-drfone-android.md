## Part 1: Understanding the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP

![bypass Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device.

### Purpose of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP

The primary purpose of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
