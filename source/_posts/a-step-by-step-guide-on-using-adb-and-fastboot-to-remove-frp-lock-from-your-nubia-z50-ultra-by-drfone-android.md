The ****Nubia Z50 Ultra FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Nubia Z50 Ultra device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Nubia Z50 Ultra device, it acts as an extra layer of security.

### What is Nubia Z50 Ultra FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.
