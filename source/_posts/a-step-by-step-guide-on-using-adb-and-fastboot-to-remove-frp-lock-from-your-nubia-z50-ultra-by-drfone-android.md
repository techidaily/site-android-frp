### What is Nubia Z50 Ultra FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nubia Z50 Ultra by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nubia Z50 Ultra device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nubia Z50 Ultra device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nubia Z50 Ultra device.
