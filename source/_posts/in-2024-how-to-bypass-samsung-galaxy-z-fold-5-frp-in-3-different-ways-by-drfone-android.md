## How To Bypass Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device and use the same Gmail account.

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

- Before using **AddROM**, ensure you have backed up important data on your device. It will help you to prevent loss during the unlocking process.

## Conclusion

We all know that FRP locks can be annoying and cause you trouble. But thankfully, there are different ways available to bypass it. We hope you successfully removed the FRP lock and regained access to your Android phone.

Using AddROM FRP bypass is indeed a complex and time-consuming method. Some users couldn't even follow all the steps and left the process in the middle. Whereas, Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is an easy and reliable alternative.

The best thing about this tool is it is not just limited to FRP bypass. There are many other features, such as data recovery, data manager, system cleaner, etc, offered by [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).
