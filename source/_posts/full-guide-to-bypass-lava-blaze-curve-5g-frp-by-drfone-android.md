During the process, it's crucial to keep your device connected to the computer and refrain from disconnecting it until the bypass is complete. After the firmware download is finished, Dr.Fone will initiate the FRP lock bypass process. Once completed, your Lava device will restart, and you'll regain access to it without encountering the FRP lock.
