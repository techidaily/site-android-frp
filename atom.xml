In recent days Poco C65 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Poco C65 device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Poco C65. It is designed to safeguard the Poco C65 device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Poco C65 FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Poco-C65-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Poco-C65-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Poco C65 FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Poco C65 FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco C65 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Poco C65 FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco C65:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Poco C65 frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Poco-C65-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Poco-C65-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Poco C65 FRP?"></a>What is Poco C65 FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C65 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C65 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C65 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco C65 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Poco-C65-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Poco-C65-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Poco C65 FRP"></a>Purpose of Poco C65 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Poco C65 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco C65 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C65 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco C65 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Poco-C65-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Poco-C65-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Poco C65 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Poco C65 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco C65 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco C65 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco C65 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-C65-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-C65-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco C65 FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco C65 FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Poco Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.</p><h3 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works?"></a>How it works?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you’ll need your phone’s Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we’ll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.</p><p>FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.</p><p>If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you’re in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.</p><p>Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.</p><p><strong>A simple list of solutions</strong></p><p>To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.</p><ul><li>Retrieve your Google account on another device</li><li>Delete Google account from Settings</li><li>Bypass Poco FRP through PC by using a USB Cable</li></ul><h2 id="Solutions-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP"><a href="#Solutions-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Solutions to Bypass Poco FRP?"></a>Solutions to Bypass Poco FRP?</h2><h3 id="Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device"><a href="#Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device" class="headerlink" title="Retrieve your Google account on another device"></a>Retrieve your Google account on another device</h3><p>The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Poco C65 .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Poco FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Poco C65  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Poco C65  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.</p><p><strong>First step:</strong></p><p>To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Poco C65  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Poco C65 . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Poco C65 , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Poco C65 device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Poco FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Poco FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Poco C65  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/realme-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="chrome"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Your file will be downloaded through the Chrome browser. Then install ES File Explorer so that you can find and open the apk file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/realme-frp-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="es file explorer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p><p>Once the ES File Explorer is installed on your phone, find the APK file downloaded to your device, and install it.

It is also included on the Poco X5 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X5 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X5 Pro device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X5 Pro device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Poco X5 Pro FRP"></a>Purpose of Poco X5 Pro FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Poco X5 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X5 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X5 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X5 Pro device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Poco X5 Pro FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Poco X5 Pro FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 12 Pro 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 12 Pro 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 12 Pro 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

In recent days Honor V Purse has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor V Purse device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor V Purse. It is designed to safeguard the Honor V Purse device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor V Purse FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-V-Purse-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-V-Purse-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor V Purse FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor V Purse FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor V Purse FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor V Purse FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor V Purse:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor V Purse frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-V-Purse-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-V-Purse-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor V Purse FRP?"></a>What is Honor V Purse FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor V Purse by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor V Purse device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor V Purse device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor V Purse device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-V-Purse-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-V-Purse-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor V Purse FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor V Purse FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor V Purse FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor V Purse device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor V Purse device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor V Purse device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-V-Purse-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-V-Purse-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor V Purse FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor V Purse FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor V Purse device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor V Purse after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor V Purse device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-V-Purse-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-V-Purse-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor V Purse FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor V Purse FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.
