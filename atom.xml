The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Realme 11 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme 11 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It is also included on the Realme GT 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT 3 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme GT 3 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Realme-GT-3-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Realme-GT-3-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Realme GT 3 FRP"></a>Purpose of Realme GT 3 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Realme GT 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme GT 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme GT 3 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme GT 3 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Realme-GT-3-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Realme-GT-3-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Realme GT 3 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Realme GT 3 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme GT 3 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme GT 3 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme GT 3 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134228/18498" target="_top" id="2134228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134228/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Realme-GT-3-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Realme-GT-3-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme GT 3 FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme GT 3 FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Realme Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one.

It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.</p><p>As a result, the user cannot restore the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory.

The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Samsung Galaxy M34 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Samsung Galaxy M34 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Samsung Galaxy M34 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Samsung smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device and the system.</p><p>This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.</p><p>As a result, the user cannot restore the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device.</p><p>The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Samsung. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Samsung-phone"><a href="#Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Samsung-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Samsung phone"></a>Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Samsung phone</h2><p>Although the factory reset protection program and the lock are beneficial to keep your device safe from other people’s hands, sometimes it can cause problems for you also.

It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Samsung frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Samsung smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Samsung before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device. While using your Samsung with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device Adequately"></a>Charging the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Samsung device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process.

Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Samsung smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the “Forget Password” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on forgot password"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> To verify your identity, utilize the phone number or recovery email associated with your Google account. You will receive a verification code on the phone number or recovery email. Once received, enter the code provided.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="add the verification code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> After completing the verification process, you can create a new password for your Google account. Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Samsung smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="login into google account"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Method-2-Using-FRP-Bypass-Tools"><a href="#Part-4-Method-2-Using-FRP-Bypass-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

One such security feature is Factory Reset Protection (FRP). This feature is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset. FRP serves its purpose of safeguarding personal information. At times it can pose a challenge for users who find themselves locked out of their own devices.</p><p>This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step <strong>Samsung FRP bypass Android 10, 11</strong>, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you’ll regain access to your Samsung smartphone even if you’ve forgotten the associated Google account credentials.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Understanding-of-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Understanding-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP"></a>Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP</h2><p>Before going after <strong>Samsung FRP bypassing Android 12</strong>, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Samsung frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass"></a>Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass</h2><p>It is crucial to make sure you’re prepared before you go after the <strong>Samsung FRP bypass the Android 13</strong>. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Samsung smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Samsung before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device. While using your Samsung with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device Adequately"></a>Charging the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Samsung device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Samsung smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the “Forget Password” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on forgot password"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> To verify your identity, utilize the phone number or recovery email associated with your Google account. You will receive a verification code on the phone number or recovery email. Once received, enter the code provided.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="add the verification code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> After completing the verification process, you can create a new password for your Google account. Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Samsung smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="login into google account"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Method-2-Using-FRP-Bypass-Tools"><a href="#Part-4-Method-2-Using-FRP-Bypass-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Its easy-to-use customer interface allows you to sort and filter by different features, including size, price, and the constructive average customer review. If you’re torn between a few choices, reading the reviews can help you discover the best set for your needs.</p><p> Moreover, Amazon offers helpful customer service and easy returns – most television orders will ship for free.

Walmart offers LED, LCD, 3D, 4K televisions, sleek curved-screen televisions, and convenient smart TVs.</p><p> Purchase new or score a great deal by browsing refurbished products. Walmart also offers value bundles that include popular accessories, making the buying process even more accessible.

Stroll through the aisles at your local store and browse everything from necessities such as toilet paper and paper towels to little luxuries like shelled nuts and wine. However, they’re also a great place to consider when looking for a new television – and you don’t have to be a member to access all of its great deals or even go to the store, thanks to its online shop.</p><p> Costco offers competitive pricing and a generous return policy that gives you a 90-day window to return a TV. They allow you to return in-store for an immediate refund. Do you live in an apartment or townhome? Costco is one of the only online retailers that offer free delivery that includes up to two flights of stairs. The main downside is that Costco only offers TVs from four brands – Samsung, Vizio, LG, and TCL – and some deals will only be available to members. However, this still gives customers a decent selection and the chance to score a great deal online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975503">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975503">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975503%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975503/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="B-H-Photo-Video-and-Pro-Audio"><a href="#B-H-Photo-Video-and-Pro-Audio" class="headerlink" title="B&amp;H Photo, Video, and Pro Audio"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Flat-Panel-Televisions/ci/2500/N/3965713807" >B&amp;H Photo, Video, and Pro Audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b-KwMxBqVu4xWj3zN6BEuRsKR20=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sony-KDL48W650D-1080p-smart-tv-5b4250efc9e77c00370da324.jpg" alt="Sony KDL-48W650D 48-inch 1080p LED/LCD TV"></p><p> Sony KDL-48W650D 48-inch 1080p LED&#x2F;LCD TV.

Shipping is free with orders over $49, and with a 30-day return window and included return labels, shopping for a new TV is about as hassle-free as possible. The website’s main page has easy-to-find contact information for customer service and corporate offices, so you can quickly ask questions about buying, shipping, and returns if you need to.</p><p> They also have a page dedicated to daily deals; this is a great way to see if you can save a little extra money without looking for promo codes or coupons. If browsing the site on the weekend, you should note that the company observes Shabbat and all Jewish holidays. So, if you put something in your cart on Friday evening, you won’t be able to checkout until after sundown on Saturday or when the holiday observance ends. They have an alert system that emails you when checkout re-opens, allowing you to pick right back up where you left off.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Choose-a-TV-Retailer-and-Get-the-Best-Deal"><a href="#How-to-Choose-a-TV-Retailer-and-Get-the-Best-Deal" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose a TV Retailer and Get the Best Deal"></a>How to Choose a TV Retailer and Get the Best Deal</h2><p> With so many brick-and-mortar and online retailers, shopping for a new TV can be a slog. Even though many big box retailers now allow for online shopping, you can still spend hours, days, or weeks scrolling through inventory selections, comparing brands and models. Shopping online for television can be daunting in its own right since you can’t physically see the TV; this makes it difficult to visualize it in your space and challenging to know the picture and audio quality.</p><p> But sometimes, shopping in-store is difficult or impossible; maybe the store doesn’t have the model you want in stock, or they have a limited television inventory. In this guide, we will walk you through some essential things to consider when shopping for a new TV in-store or online. We’ll talk about inventory and brand selection, price matching policies, shipping and delivery options, and even how to utilize user reviews to choose the best TV for your home.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tv-5226082" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Visit-a-Brick-and-Mortar-Store-if-You-Can"><a href="#Visit-a-Brick-and-Mortar-Store-if-You-Can" class="headerlink" title="Visit a Brick and Mortar Store if You Can"></a>Visit a Brick and Mortar Store if You Can</h2><p> To help you decide before you buy, don’t be afraid to do a bit of in-store shopping to see a potential buy in action; you can check out and compare the picture quality and hear the audio clarity for yourself as you browse the display models for each brand, giving you valuable information that may be difficult to find online.</p><p> Sometimes, you can find a great deal while you’re there, but going back home to buy online can frequently allow you to take advantage of online-only rebates or coupons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4_13trq9nGaUcIe22YsnP8pPy_U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ikea-TV-Stand-Makeover-via-smallspaces.about.com-56a889403df78cf7729ea039.jpg"                      alt="Ikea TV Stand Makeover"                ></p><p> Song Bird Blog via HomeTalk</p><h2 id="Brand-Selection"><a href="#Brand-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Brand Selection"></a>Brand Selection</h2><p> The number of brands available in-store or on a retailer’s website is essential when considering a new TV for your home or dorm. You should check if the store carries major brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG and smaller brands like Hisense, Vizio, and TCL. Various brands give you a better selection of screen sizes, smart features, and price points. More well-known brands tend to run pricier, while smaller brands are more affordable. However, while choosing the cheapest option to save money may be tempting, you may get burned with lackluster warranties and poor customer support.</p><p> If you’re thinking of springing for the most expensive television, you may be paying for features you don’t need and won’t use. It’s important to consider what you want your new television to do and where you’ll have it in your home. Will it be the primary television in your living room or home theater? You’ll want a decent-sized screen and plenty of smart features to binge-watch your favorite shows and movies. Will it be a secondary TV in your bedroom or kids’ playroom? Look at smaller televisions and models without streaming capabilities to monitor what your children are watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4NlrvFP4z3ApRPaGZXmBbs26QbI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-frame-tv-aaa-59b6dd7dd088c0001176262c.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Frame TV - TV Viewing Mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123733/7443" target="_top" id="2123733">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123733" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123733/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Samsung Frame TV - TV Viewing Mode.  Image provided by Samsung</p><h2 id="Price-Matching"><a href="#Price-Matching" class="headerlink" title="Price Matching"></a>Price Matching</h2><p> Have you ever bought something in-store or online, only to find the same thing at a different place for a better price? Many retailers have a price matching policy; if you find the same television model at one of their competitors for a better price, they’ll match it to keep you as a loyal customer. To take advantage of this, you often need a copy of the sale ad or promotional price to show as proof, and the sale price usually has to be the most recent to claim a price match.</p><p> Price matching can be a great way to save money and get a good deal on a new TV if store loyalty is essential to you. It’s also great for customers who live in areas where there are only a few retailers; for example, if Walmart is the only big box store near you, but you’ve found an excellent TV sale price at Best Buy an hour away, you can take the sale ad to Walmart and still get a good deal. Not all stores offer this policy, so it’s essential to ask an associate or customer service representative beforehand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u4fTSa3rYLdZIC2otIcwcOHHurM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ikea-TV-Stand-Hack-DIY-via-smallspaces.about.jpg-56a889425f9b58b7d0f3249b.jpg"                      alt="Wall Mounted TV and Media Console"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Home-Delivery-and-Site-to-Store-Shipping"><a href="#Home-Delivery-and-Site-to-Store-Shipping" class="headerlink" title="Home Delivery and Site-to-Store Shipping"></a>Home Delivery and Site-to-Store Shipping</h2><p> If you have a smaller vehicle or can’t borrow a van or truck from a friend or family member, you may want to consider buying from a home-delivery retailer. You can ask customer service about having a TV that was purchased in-store delivered to your home; some stores even have staff who will help you set up your new TV and make sure everything works before leaving, making returns easier. It eliminates awkward and dangerous driving with a larvae TV box half hanging out of your trunk.</p><p> Many retailers now offer site-to-store shipping. You can order a television from the retailer’s website, have it shipped to the store for free, and pick it up the next day or at your convenience. It’s an excellent option for people who live in apartment buildings or are worried about having a high-priced item shipped directly to their home. Shipping to the store for pickup later means that your new TV will be kept safe from theft and damage from bad weather.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wdMTZhhZc9_E-15Voa_X1sEBMSU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-142547173-woman-tvs-5983293622fa3a001036d2c4-401fe3c9e27a416992b3c22c5c12c24b.jpg"                      alt="Woman Standing In Electronics Store Facing TVs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918714/19272" target="_top" id="1918714">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918714" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918714/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image provided by Getty Images - Glow Images, Inc - Collection: Glow - 142547173</p><h2 id="In-Store-Expertise-and-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#In-Store-Expertise-and-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="In-Store Expertise and Customer Reviews"></a>In-Store Expertise and Customer Reviews</h2><p> If you have trouble deciding between brands or models, you can always ask in-store associates for an explanation or advice. Many stores have dedicated electronics staff who can answer your pricing, size and features questions. They can also explain store returns and exchange policies if you end up with a dud. If you’re shopping online, customer reviews are the best place to see if a particular brand or model is worth buying. But don’t just read the 5-star reviews; sometimes, reading the 1- and 2-star reviews first can give you an idea of common problems you may encounter with a model.</p><p> You can also get a feel for how many dead-on-arrival (DOA) units a manufacturer has let slip into the market. At the same time, getting a TV set up and realizing you have a dead unit is frustrating. Unfortunately, it happens. Quality Assurance departments work hard to ensure that top-notch, working products reach the hands of customers, but they can’t catch every bad unit. It’s also important to focus on negative reviews about the television rather than a poor shopping or shipping experience. A broken screen from rough shipping and handling and rude store staff are inconvenient, but these complaints don’t indicate how the TV works or malfunctions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/32-to-39-inch-lcd-led-lcd-tvs-1847947" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Is OLED better than QLED?<br> An OLED television uses cutting edge technology and organic substrates to create the picture you see. With this tech, an OLED TV is capable of a wider range of colors, better detailing, and deeper contrasts, giving you unparalleled picture quality. A QLED television uses traditional LED back or side-lighting and panels. While it isn’t quite as good as an OLED, you can still get a great picture with a QLED television.</li><li>Is it worth buying an 8K TV?<br> In all honesty? No. Televisions capable of native 8K resolution are insanely expensive right now, some costing as much as a brand new car, and no streaming, cable, or over-air services offer native 8K content. It will probably be a few years still before we begin to see 8K video available for streaming or with cable, satellite, and over-air broadcast channels, so it’s best to wait before investing in an 8K television.</li><li>What is a laser TV?<br> A laser TV works like a projector; it uses LED laser bulbs to create a picture in 1080p or 4K resolution. The difference between a laser TV and a standard projector is that a laser TV has an incredibly short throw distance, with some needing just 6 inches of space between it and the wall! This means you won’t have to have a huge room in your house or outdoor theater in order to use one.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Nubia FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Nubia phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Nubia FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Nubia-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Nubia-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Nubia phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Nubia FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Nubia phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Nubia-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Nubia-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Nubia Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Nubia Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Nubia users to bypass FRP on any Nubia brand.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re sick and tired of running out of USB ports, and you never want to fumble with the back of your computer again, Anker has you covered. The Anker<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub seeks to end your connectivity woes at once, providing nine USB 3.0 data ports and one charging optimized data port, capable of delivering more than twice as much juice as the rest.</p><p> If you need a no-frills solution to your USB port problem, the Anker is a pretty good choice. This straightforward solution does exactly what it sets out to with little fuss. Still, there is competition lurking out there, and some of it is coming from other Anker products. Let’s explore the pros and cons and determine if this is the right choice for your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kGkNOMrJekQ_xSVZJ4N4nLG1il0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_02-dbb624f3c041432baecfa2701dbc933a.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Lots-of-ports-in-a-standard-configuration"><a href="#Design-Lots-of-ports-in-a-standard-configuration" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lots of ports in a standard configuration"></a><strong>Design: Lots of ports in a standard configuration</strong></h2><p> At 1.7 x 5.7 x 0.9 inches HWD), the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is just about as lean as one might reasonably expect for a device with this many ports. The design is relatively simple, featuring a long rectangular shape, rounded edges, and a thick plastic construction. The device feels very light, but it’s not flimsy.</p><p> The top of the device includes the ten USB 3.0 ports, the last of which is marked with a charging icon.</p><p> The top of the device includes the ten USB 3.0 ports, the last of which is marked with a charging icon. Each port has a number next to it that illuminates when a device is connected. Above the first port is a power LED to indicate a power connection. Around to the side from this LED is the power port and USB 3.0 type B port.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tQ3zuDbd3YhyVxZS3iM0i5RcsOc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_03-1167acd92ea14e1db605adf2154e0d60.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-painless"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-painless" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Quick and painless"></a><strong>Setup Process: Quick and painless</strong></h2><p> To set up the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub, remove the main hub from its packaging and connect the supplied USB (A-to-B) cable to both the hub and your computer. Next, connect the power source to an outlet. After that, the hub works out of the box. The manual provides a cursory overview of the operation of the device, but you likely won’t need it.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Data-and-fast-charging"><a href="#Connectivity-Data-and-fast-charging" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Data and fast charging"></a><strong>Connectivity: Data and fast charging</strong></h2><p> The Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub comes with a USB (A-to-B) cable to connect to your computer. An AC power adapter is included as well, and comes with a sizable power brick. The hub gives users ten USB 3.0 ports, offering a maximum transfer speed of 5Gbps. The charging port delivers more power than the other 9 making it ideal for charging more power hungry devices like phones and tablets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LqAWiFxZU1YqrVq2KbjQzkz6xMI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_04-0c115139eb2842759c6a8ceb22719901.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186864/12108" target="_top" id="1186864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186864/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-A-few-shortcomings"><a href="#Performance-A-few-shortcomings" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A few shortcomings"></a><strong>Performance: A few shortcomings</strong></h2><p> The Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub performed as promised in our tests, providing the expected 5Gbps speeds. The first nine ports supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the final charging port can supply up to 2.0A. If you neglect to connect the hub to a power source, the entire device will have to share the 0.9A of power supplied by your computer’s USB 3.0 port.</p><p> This straightforward solution does exactly what it sets out to with little fuss.</p><p> One area we take issue with Anker is in their product description online, which cautions against using the hub with high-power consumption devices, such as external hard drives. This might just be to protect themselves from liability, but it’s a frustrating cop-out, as a significant reason for buying a powered USB hub in the first place is to avoid potential issues with external hard drives that stem from inadequate power supply.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fKjtHR68Qc_w-DpUN_vILXXO77o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_05-418b32eddbca47968b9a9043db285b2f.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-little-steep-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-A-little-steep-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little steep for the features"></a><strong>Price: A little steep for the features</strong></h2><p> At a list price of $52.99, the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is a little expensive for what it offers. We would have expected a price of around $10-13 less given the feature set. Anker itself offers cheaper, newer options that stand a good chance at luring shoppers away from this device.</p><h2 id="Anker-USB-3-0-SuperSpeed-10-Port-Hub-vs-Anker-10-Port-60W-Data-Hub-with-7-USB-3-0-Ports-and-3-PowerIQ-Charging-Ports"><a href="#Anker-USB-3-0-SuperSpeed-10-Port-Hub-vs-Anker-10-Port-60W-Data-Hub-with-7-USB-3-0-Ports-and-3-PowerIQ-Charging-Ports" class="headerlink" title="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub vs. Anker 10 Port 60W Data Hub with 7 USB 3.0 Ports and 3 PowerIQ Charging Ports"></a><strong>Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub vs. Anker 10 Port 60W Data Hub with 7 USB 3.0 Ports and 3 PowerIQ Charging Ports</strong></h2><p> One of the fiercest competitors to the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is Anker’s own 10 Port 60W Data Hub. This model, 2 years newer, features 7 data ports and 3 PowerIQ dedicated charging ports at 2.1A. The kicker? This model only costs $42.99, forcing shoppers to decide how badly they_really_ need those extra data ports.
