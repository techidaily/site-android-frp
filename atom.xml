The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone.

But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Nubia FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Nubia-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Nubia-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Nubia phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Nubia FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Nubia phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C51 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C51 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C51 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C51-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C51-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.</p><h3 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works?"></a>How it works?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you’ll need your phone’s Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we’ll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.</p><p>FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.</p><p>If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you’re in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone.

You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Poco C55 .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Poco FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Poco C55  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme.

You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Poco C55  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Poco C55 . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Poco C55 , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Poco C55 device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Poco FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Poco FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Poco C55  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset.

But there are reasons to consider other options. Let’s explore them.</p><p>Technical Knowledge Required</p><p>It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you’re not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It’s not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.</p><p>Limited Customer Support</p><p>Thetooldoesn’t provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.</p><p>Limited Compatibility</p><p><strong>Pangu FRP bypass</strong> is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg"                      alt="otg for android phone"                ></p><p>Safety Concerns</p><p>Some <strong>Pangu FRP bypass APK</strong> versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn’t always the case, it’s crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.</p><p>Low Success Rate</p><p>While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn’t guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn’t work on your device. Choosing other <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html"><u> FRP bypass software</u></a> with a higher success rate can save you time.</p><p>Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills. If you’re comfortable with downloading APK, Pangu can work.

However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 11 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes.

However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Realme smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Realme 12 Pro 5G device and the system.</p><p>This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Realme 12 Pro 5G device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account.

It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>This <strong>Realme C53  FRP bypass</strong> article gives an insight into the methods you can use to remove the FRP lock. However, if you have a other Android brand phone, the best one of all methods is using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme C53 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version.

It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Realme C55 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Realme C55 device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Realme C55 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Realme C55 device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Realme C55 device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Realme C55 device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Realme smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13.

Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Realme before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Realme C55 device. While using your Realme with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Realme-C55-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Realme-C55-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Realme C55 device Adequately"></a>Charging the Realme C55 device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Realme device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Realme smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password.
