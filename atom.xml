The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco X6 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco X6 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco X6 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco X6 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco X6 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X6-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X6-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It is also included on the Poco X6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X6 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X6 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Poco-X6-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Poco-X6-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Poco X6 FRP"></a>Purpose of Poco X6 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Poco X6 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X6 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X6 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X6 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X6-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X6-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Poco X6 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Poco X6 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco X6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco X6 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-X6-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-X6-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco X6 FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco X6 FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Poco Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you.

You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Poco FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you.

The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Poco FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#.

After you do a factory reset on your Poco smartphone, don’t rush to set it up. If you set up your device, the FRP lock will appear on the screen. When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That’s where you will be entering the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong>. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="bypass code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Power on your Poco device after the factory reset.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Start the Poco M6 Pro 5G device set up and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After you enable the Wi-Fi connection, return to the welcome screen.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on the “Emergency Call” option at the bottom left of the language selection page.</li><li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Type one of the FRP bypass codes (*#813# or *#812#) on the dialer and tap on the “Dial” button.</li><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Next, don’t do anything and wait for the home screen of your Poco device to appear.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Poco FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Poco .</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?"></a>Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?</h2><p>Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Poco FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Efficient-Ways-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Efficient-Ways-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Efficient Ways to Bypass Poco FRP"></a>Part 2: Efficient Ways to Bypass Poco FRP</h2><p>In this part, we will explore three efficient methods to bypass Poco FRP and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p><h3 id="A-Comprehensive-Comparison-of-Three-Methods-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP"><a href="#A-Comprehensive-Comparison-of-Three-Methods-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensive Comparison of Three Methods to Bypass Poco FRP"></a>A Comprehensive Comparison of Three Methods to Bypass Poco FRP</h3><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Method</strong></th><th><strong>Advantages</strong></th><th><strong>Disadvantages</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-oppo-frp.html#Part1-1" >Wondershare Dr.Fone [Fast &amp; Easy] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>1. <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a fast and efficient FRP bypass process, ensuring quick access to your Poco device.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2. <strong>User-Friendly</strong>: The software comes with an intuitive interface, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3.

You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>.

The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds.

After you do a factory reset on your Poco smartphone, don’t rush to set it up. If you set up your device, the FRP lock will appear on the screen. When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That’s where you will be entering the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong>. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="bypass code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Power on your Poco device after the factory reset.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Start the Poco M6 Pro 4G device set up and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After you enable the Wi-Fi connection, return to the welcome screen.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on the “Emergency Call” option at the bottom left of the language selection page.</li><li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Type one of the FRP bypass codes (*#813# or *#812#) on the dialer and tap on the “Dial” button.</li><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Next, don’t do anything and wait for the home screen of your Poco device to appear. You might see some alerts, but you don’t have to touch the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Once you enter your phone, open “Settings” and go to “About phone”.</li><li><strong>Step 8.</strong> Enable Developer options by tapping on the android version between seven to ten times.</li><li><strong>Step 9.</strong> From the Developer Options, enable USB debugging.</li><li><strong>Step 10.</strong> Now, go back to “Settings” and reset your Poco device from the “Factory Data Reset” option.</li><li><strong>Step 11.</strong> Once the reset is complete, you can set up your device and enter it without FRP.</li></ul><h3 id="3-By-Talkback-Method-to-Bypass"><a href="#3-By-Talkback-Method-to-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3: By Talkback Method to Bypass"></a>3: By Talkback Method to Bypass</h3><p>For those seeking a manual approach, the Talkback Method involves leveraging the accessibility feature on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. Before using the Talkback method, ensure that your phone has more than 50% battery backup and an internet connection. The Talkback method will not work on devices with the latest Android operating system. Here are the steps to bypass <strong>Poco FRP</strong> lock with the Talkback method.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="android phone talkback feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Power on your Poco smartphone and hold the volume up + down buttons at the same time to enable the Talkback feature.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select “Turn on” to open the Talkback shortcut.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Poco FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Poco .</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?"></a>Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?</h2><p>Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Poco FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Poco FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Poco FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Poco .</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Poco-FRP-Bypass-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?"></a>Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?</h2><p>Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Poco FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Poco FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Efficient-Ways-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Efficient-Ways-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Efficient Ways to Bypass Poco FRP"></a>Part 2: Efficient Ways to Bypass Poco FRP</h2><p>In this part, we will explore three efficient methods to bypass Poco FRP and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p><h3 id="A-Comprehensive-Comparison-of-Three-Methods-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP"><a href="#A-Comprehensive-Comparison-of-Three-Methods-to-Bypass-Poco-FRP" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensive Comparison of Three Methods to Bypass Poco FRP"></a>A Comprehensive Comparison of Three Methods to Bypass Poco FRP</h3><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Method</strong></th><th><strong>Advantages</strong></th><th><strong>Disadvantages</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-oppo-frp.html#Part1-1" >Wondershare Dr.Fone [Fast &amp; Easy] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td>1. <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a fast and efficient FRP bypass process, ensuring quick access to your Poco device.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2. <strong>User-Friendly</strong>: The software comes with an intuitive interface, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3.

It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco C65 device from unauthorized access.

By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Poco C65 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Poco C65 device. In essence, the Poco C65 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.</p><p>It prevents unauthorized access to the Poco C65 device, providing additional protection.

When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly.

You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Poco C55 .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Poco FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password.

So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Poco C55  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme.

You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Poco C55  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Poco C55 . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Poco C55 , tap “Remove account” once more to verify.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Honor FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Honor FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Honor .</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Honor-FRP-Bypass-Code"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Honor-FRP-Bypass-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Honor FRP Bypass Code?"></a>Part 1: What is Honor FRP Bypass Code?</h2><p>Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Honor FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Honor FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#.

If you can’t pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the <strong>Honor FRP</strong> lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don’t know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.</p><p>One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the <strong>Honor FRP code</strong>. If you don’t want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you.

The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn’t allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the <strong>Honor FRP bypass code</strong> to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.</p><p>Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English <strong>Honor FRP</strong> <strong>code</strong> is *#813#, and the Chinese code is *#812#.

After you do a factory reset on your Honor smartphone, don’t rush to set it up. If you set up your device, the FRP lock will appear on the screen. When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That’s where you will be entering the <strong>Honor FRP bypass code</strong>. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="bypass code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Power on your Honor device after the factory reset.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Start the Honor Magic 6 Lite device set up and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After you enable the Wi-Fi connection, return to the welcome screen.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on the “Emergency Call” option at the bottom left of the language selection page.</li><li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Type one of the FRP bypass codes (*#813# or *#812#) on the dialer and tap on the “Dial” button.</li><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Next, don’t do anything and wait for the home screen of your Honor device to appear. You might see some alerts, but you don’t have to touch the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Once you enter your phone, open “Settings” and go to “About phone”.</li><li><strong>Step 8.</strong> Enable Developer options by tapping on the android version between seven to ten times.</li><li><strong>Step 9.</strong> From the Developer Options, enable USB debugging.</li><li><strong>Step 10.</strong> Now, go back to “Settings” and reset your Honor device from the “Factory Data Reset” option.</li><li><strong>Step 11.</strong> Once the reset is complete, you can set up your device and enter it without FRP.</li></ul><h3 id="3-By-Talkback-Method-to-Bypass"><a href="#3-By-Talkback-Method-to-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="3: By Talkback Method to Bypass"></a>3: By Talkback Method to Bypass</h3><p>For those seeking a manual approach, the Talkback Method involves leveraging the accessibility feature on the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. Before using the Talkback method, ensure that your phone has more than 50% battery backup and an internet connection. The Talkback method will not work on devices with the latest Android operating system.

Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Honor before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Honor Play 40C device. While using your Honor with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Honor-Play-40C-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Honor-Play-40C-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Honor Play 40C device Adequately"></a>Charging the Honor Play 40C device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process.

This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Honor smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password.

But there are reasons to consider other options. Let’s explore them.</p><p>Technical Knowledge Required</p><p>It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you’re not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It’s not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.</p><p>Limited Customer Support</p><p>Thetooldoesn’t provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.</p><p>Limited Compatibility</p><p><strong>Pangu FRP bypass</strong> is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg"                      alt="otg for android phone"                ></p><p>Safety Concerns</p><p>Some <strong>Pangu FRP bypass APK</strong> versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn’t always the case, it’s crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.</p><p>Low Success Rate</p><p>While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn’t guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn’t work on your device. Choosing other <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html"><u> FRP bypass software</u></a> with a higher success rate can save you time.</p><p>Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme V30 FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30 FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30 FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme V30</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 12 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 12 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 12 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Realme 12 5G device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-4.jpg"                      alt="add sim to tecno pop 5"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap “Emergency,” where the Realme 12 5G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-5.jpg"                      alt="provide sim passcode"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After pressing “Emergency,” tap “Emergency Information” on the next screen.

Please help.” A user says so on Quora.</p><p>In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Realme  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises.

Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.</p><p>You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.</p><ul><li>You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.</li><li>Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.</li><li>You can permanently delete the Google account.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It ties your Google account to the Realme Narzo N55 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme Narzo N55 device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>The Pangu FRP Bypass boasts extensive compatibility with several Android brands, covering:</p><ul><li>Samsung</li><li>Lenovo</li><li>LG</li><li>Oppo</li><li>HTC</li><li>Micromax</li><li>Vivo, and more</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-03.jpg"                      alt="android smartphone logo"                ></p><p>Different devices and Android OS versions may have varying compatibility within each brand.

Please help.” A user says so on Quora.</p><p>In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Realme  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises.

Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.</p><p>You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.</p><ul><li>You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.</li><li>Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.</li><li>You can permanently delete the Google account.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
