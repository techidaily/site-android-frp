FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme GT Neo 5 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme GT 5 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Once the Realme GT 5 device is connected, click <strong>“Toolbox”</strong> &gt; “<strong>Screen Unlock</strong>“ to open options on the new window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="Select Screen Unlock from the menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will see two options on your screen.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme GT 5 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme GT 5 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.

Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Realme frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Realme GT 5 (240W) device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Realme GT 5 (240W) device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Realme GT 5 (240W) device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Realme GT 5 (240W) device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Realme GT 5 (240W) device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Realme GT 5 (240W) device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Realme smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13.

This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Realme GT 5 (240W) device. While using your Realme with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme C55 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article.

How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme 12 5G device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme 11X 5G device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme 11 Pro+ device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="AddROM-Bypass-An-Android-Tool-to-Unlock-FRP-Lock-Screen-For-your-Realme-11-Pro"><a href="#AddROM-Bypass-An-Android-Tool-to-Unlock-FRP-Lock-Screen-For-your-Realme-11-Pro" class="headerlink" title="AddROM Bypass: An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Realme 11 Pro"></a>AddROM Bypass: An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Realme 11 Pro</h2><p>Are you an Android user? Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme 11 Pro device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does AddROM Really Work?"></a>Part 3. Does AddROM Really Work?</h2><p>The success rate of the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> can only be endorsed from the reviews of previous users. They can tell us if the users successfully bypass the FRP locks with this tool. From anecdotal research, we have discovered that some users could bypass the lock.</p><p>However, there were a lot of users who reported that they regained access to their phones. On the contrary, we also discovered that some users complained about the inefficiency of this tool.

It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme 11 Pro device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Realme 10T 5G device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Poco X6 Pro device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again.

Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Poco frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Poco X6 Pro device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Poco X6 Pro device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Poco X6 Pro device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Poco X6 Pro device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Poco X6 Pro device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Poco X6 Pro device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Poco smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Poco before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Poco X6 Pro device. While using your Poco with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Poco-X6-Pro-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Poco-X6-Pro-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Poco X6 Pro device Adequately"></a>Charging the Poco X6 Pro device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Poco device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Poco smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser.

It is also included on the Poco X6 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X6 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X6 Pro device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X6 Pro device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Poco X6 Pro FRP"></a>Purpose of Poco X6 Pro FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Poco X6 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X6 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X6 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X6 Pro device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Poco X6 Pro FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Poco X6 Pro FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco X6 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco X6 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco X6 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Poco-X6-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco X6 Pro FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco X6 Pro FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Poco Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article.

How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Poco X6 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list.
