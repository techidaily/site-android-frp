The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Realme 11 Pro+ smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme 11 Pro+ Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro+ device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Realme 11 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme 11 Pro Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco X6 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco X6 Pro Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco X6 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco X6 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco X6 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X6-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X6-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco X6 Pro device.

How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Poco X6 Pro device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco X5 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco X5 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco X5 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco X5 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco X5 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X5-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-X5-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco X5 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco X5 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Poco X5 device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco M6 Pro 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco M6 Pro 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco M6 Pro 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco M6 Pro 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco M6 Pro 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco M6 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco M6 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco M6 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco M6 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco M6 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco M6 5G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco M6 5G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Poco M6 5G device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco F5 Pro 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco F5 Pro 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco F5 Pro 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco F5 Pro 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Poco F5 Pro 5G device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco F5 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco F5 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco F5 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco F5 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco F5 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?"></a>1. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco F5 5G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco F5 5G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco M6 Pro 4G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco M6 Pro 4G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco M6 Pro 4G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco M6 Pro 4G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Poco-C65-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Poco-C65-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco C65 Devices"></a>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco C65 Devices</h2><p>Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco C65 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco C65 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C65 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C65 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C65 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C65-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C65-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco C55 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco C55 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C55 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C55 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C55 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C55-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C55-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Poco-C50-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Poco-C50-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco C50 Devices"></a>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Poco C50 Devices</h2><p>Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco C50 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco C50 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C50 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C50 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C50 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C50-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C50-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Honor-X9b-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Honor-X9b-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Honor X9b Devices"></a>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Honor X9b Devices</h2><p>Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor X9b smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor X9b Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor X9b device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor X9b device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor X9b phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-X9b-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-X9b-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor X9b device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Honor X9b device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor X9b device.

It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Honor X9b device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor X50i+ smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor X50i+ Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor X50i+ device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor X50i+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor X50i+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-X50i-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-X50i-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all.

The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor X50i+ device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor X50i+ device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Honor X50i+ device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor X50i+ device.

It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Honor X50i+ device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor Magic 6 Lite smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor Magic 6 Lite Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Magic 6 Lite device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 Lite phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor Magic 6 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor Magic 6 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Magic 6 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Magic 6 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Magic-6-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Magic-6-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor 90 GT smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor 90 GT Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 90 GT device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 90 GT device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 90 GT phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-90-GT-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-90-GT-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Honor 90 GT device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Honor 90 GT device.

How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor 90 GT device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor 100 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor 100 Pro Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 100 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 100 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 100 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-100-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-100-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
