The AtomMan G7 Pt, however, is somewhere in-between as a Mini PC featuring mobile processors. For the rest of the specs check out the table below.</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX Processor, 16C&#x2F;32T (64M Cache, up to 5.4 GHz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT (GDDR6 8G)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>DDR5-5200 Dual channel (SODIMM Slots×2, Max 96GB)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe5.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Expansion</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe4.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Connectivity</td><td>M.2 2230 Wi-Fi support (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Video Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；USB-C ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；3.5mm Combo Jack ×1；Line out ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Peripherals Interface</td><td>RJ45 2.5G Ethernet Port×1 USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×1(In Front) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×3(In Back) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Front, Data Only) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Back, Alt Data and DP) HDMI ×1 DisplayPort ×1 3.5mm Combo Jack ×1 Line out ×1 Mic in ×1 Clear CMOS ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>DC 19V (adapter included)</td></tr><tr><td>System</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCXcTW8u5XFwpHJ2k5ueD6-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> The AMD Dragon Range CPU and RX7600M XT may not be the newest or most powerful AMD combo a PC maker could assemble in mid-2024. Nevertheless, they should do a pretty good job delivering a capable mini gaming system experience, as long as user ambitions for higher resolutions (like 4K) and raytracing are kept in check.</p><p> Another thing that needs to be carefully kept in check in a mini system is cooling. Minisforum touts the capabilities of its Cold Wave Ultra cooling system, which uses “a vertical single heat pipe with dual air inlets in series and dual-sided quad fans.” Complementing the processor cooling, it has also fitted “an enhanced DDR&#x2F;SSD active cooler and dual liquid metal 8-heat pipe separated link.” The firm claims the cooling fitted into the AtomMan G7 Pt can cope with up to 205W, without fan noise breaching 45dB.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Other aspects of the interior specs worth commenting on are the device’s easy upgrades with twin DDR5-5200 SODOMM slots for up to 96GB RAM. Also, it has two M.2 storage slots (PCIe5.0 and PCIe4.0), and a socketed wireless card.</p><p> Connectivity seems pretty good for such a small box. As well as Wi-Fi 7 there is a 2.5G Ethernet port, and you can connect up to three 4K monitors at once (HDMI, DP, and USB-C). Six USB ports are available in total, with all being USB 3.2 Gen2 rated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vH5yUKbtEt5tHuJMtPYk5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> One of the bigger changes we have seen added to the AtomMan G7 Pt since its name was switched from the HX200G is the provision of dual RGB backlighting panels. The example logo scrawl provides a prime example of beauty being in the eye of the beholder.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Pricing for the AtomMan G7 Pt hasn’t been divulged, though we have written back to Minisforum for some pricing details.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>This <strong>Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G  FRP bypass</strong> article gives an insight into the methods you can use to remove the FRP lock.

These specs are pretty light by modern standards, but they seem sensible for a device tailored purely to making or playing music with attached keyboards, MIDI devices, and speakers.</p><p> Per the official page, the primary purpose of the Tulip computer is to make and play music. Still, its support for Python programming also makes it capable of displaying a variety of sprites, PNGs, backgrounds, etc— which means even lightweight games should be makeable or playable on the device. There’s no real multimedia or web browsing functionality here besides. However, Tulip also has access to an exclusive BBS Tulip WORLD system for sharing music files and chatting with other users.</p><p> Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1lYFjQp7Xrw/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1lYFjQp7Xrw" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The synthesizer at the heart of Tulip is the AMY (Addictive Music synthesizer librarY), another FOSS project made to be integrated across “almost any program, architecture, or microcontroller” and usable as an FM synthesizer, analog-type synthesizer, drum machine, or even a breakpoint synthesizer.

Like other manufacturers, Honor uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Honor X50 device would be able to access the Honor X50 device.

Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Honor X50 devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2.

The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme V30 FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30 FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30 FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme V30</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone.

It’s a Mini PC in the form of an official Dev Kit, which undercuts (<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1069194734322795598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-computer-laptops/new-inspiron-14-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7441-laptop/useichbts7441hcjp?ref=variantstack" >or at least matches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) the price of even the lower-end Snapdragon X Plus laptops, and it’s set for a full launch on August 23rd, though it’s also already available for pre-order on<a class="link"   href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm" >Arrow.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for just $899 USD.</p><p> We just reviewed a Snapdragon X Elite laptop— the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-13-9345-review" >Dell XPS 13 9345 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — and that unit retails for $1299, which is about $400 pricier for the laptop form factor.</p><h2 id="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications"><a href="#Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications"></a>Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>SoC</strong> : Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X-1E-00-1DE, specs divided between CPU, GPU, and NPU below</li><li><strong>CPU</strong> : Qualcomm Oryon CPU with 12 cores rated at up to 3.8 GHz, or 4.3 with Dual Core Boost; 42 MB cache</li><li><strong>GPU</strong> : Qualcomm Adreno GPU rated for 4.6 Teraflops</li><li><strong>NPU</strong> : Qualcomm Hexagon NPU rated for 45 TOPS</li><li><strong>RAM</strong> : 32GB LPDDR5X RAM</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> : 512 GB “Fast” NVMe SSD</li><li><strong>OS</strong> : Windows 11</li><li><strong>Size</strong> : 199 mm x 175 mm x 35 mm, or 8 x 7 x 1.3 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> : 970 grams, or ~2.1 lbs</li><li><strong>I&#x2F;O</strong> : 3 USB4 Type-C ports (1 Front), 2 USB 3.2 Type-A ports; 1 Ethernet port; 1 HDMI port; 1 3.5mm audio port</li></ul><p> So, who is this Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite Mini PC really for? As advertised, it’s targeted at developers, which makes sense— if you’re hoping to target ARM-native software for the X Elite chips hitting the laptop or want to properly test and tweak your x86-native software for use with those devices, this seems like the way to go. But if the enhanced AI features (<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/live/copilot-pc-launch-2024" >Copilot+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) of the Snapdragon X Elite happen to hold particularly high appeal to you and your workflows, that’s another reason this piece of kit could be compelling.</p><p> For gaming purposes, we definitely wouldn’t recommend the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform at this time. While it’s true that some games work and even the new image scaling options added just for Windows ARM and these devices are compelling, the overall gaming performance and compatibility of Snapdragon X Elite just isn’t competitive with x86 gaming laptops at this time. Other iGPUs—<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-suffer-compatibility-issues-with-many-games#xenforo-comments-3848147" >even_Intel_ iGPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — provide a much better experience.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> But it’s not all doom and gloom in the world of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops — or Mini PCs in this case — as long as you have the requisite monitor and peripherals to get it up and running. You generally have a pretty usable version of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here, and a number of productivity and creative applications that will work perfectly fine.

However, many players are complaining that they encounter many performance issues when playing the game. And one of the issues that trouble many players is the<strong>black screen problem on startup</strong> . When this happens, players can see and move the game cursor and hear the music playing, but nothing else is displayed. If you’re facing the same issue, don’t worry.

When your game is running, you can press<strong>Alt+Enter</strong> at the same time to switch between the windowed mode and full-screen mode. If this doesn’t work, you can try setting launch options in Steam. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open your Steam Library.</li><li>Right-click<strong>Elden Ring</strong> and select<strong>Properties…</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Elden-Ring-steam-properties.jpg"                                     ></li><li>On the<strong>General</strong> tab, you’ll find the<strong>Launch Options</strong> section. Then enter the following parameters to open the game in windowed mode:</li></ol><p><strong>-windowed</strong><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Elden-Ring-windowed-mode.jpg"                                     ><br>4. Close the<strong>Properties</strong> window and launch the game.</p><p> If the black screen occurs again, don’t worry.

If Windows is responsive, your screen will flash and then the game should work fine. But if not, go ahead with the next fix.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Update-your-graphics-driver"><a href="#Fix-3-Update-your-graphics-driver" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Update your graphics driver"></a>Fix 3: Update your graphics driver</h3><p> The black screen issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To see if that’s the case, you should update your graphics driver to the latest version. This may not only fix the potential problem but also improve your game performance.</p><p>There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="http://www.amd.com/drivers" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme C67 4G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme C67 4G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme C67 4G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-C67-4G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-C67-4G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Realme C67 4G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Realme C67 4G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Realme C67 4G device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Realme C67 4G phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)</h3><p>Unlock Your Realme C67 4G Phone in a Flash</p><ul><li>Remove 5 screen lock types: pattern, PIN, password, ingerprints &amp; Face ID.</li><li>Bypass Android FRP lock without a PIN or Google account.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li><li>Unlock mainstream Android brands like Samsung, Huawei, LG, Xiaomi, etc.</li><li>No tech knowledge required, Simple, click-through, process.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-accelerated-approach-eliminating-signatures-quickly/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Accelerated Approach Eliminating Signatures Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-creative-channel-themes-get-them-for-free/"><u>[Updated] Creative Channel Themes Get Them for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-closing-in-on-the-essence-of-cinematic-action/"><u>2024 Approved Closing in on the Essence of Cinematic Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/addrom-bypass-an-android-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-for-your-oneplus-12-by-drfone-android/"><u>AddROM Bypass An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your OnePlus 12</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/dota-2-fix-overcome-launch-issues-and-loading-screen-freeze/"><u>Dota 2 Fix: Overcome Launch Issues & Loading Screen Freeze</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/from-adventure-to-audience-transforming-gopro-footage-with-social-media/"><u>From Adventure to Audience Transforming Gopro Footage with Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-oppo-reno-11-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP on Oppo Reno 11 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-motorola-moto-g13-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Motorola Moto G13 Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-nokia-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Nokia Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-oppo-a38-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Oppo A38 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-locked-or-disabled-on-apple-iphone-se-2022-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme Note 50 FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Note-50-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Note-50-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Note 50 FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Note 50 FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme Note 50</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>This <strong>Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro  FRP bypass</strong> article gives an insight into the methods you can use to remove the FRP lock.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Poco X5 Pro FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Poco FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Poco phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Poco-X5-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco X5 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco X5 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Poco FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Poco-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Poco-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Poco-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Poco-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Poco Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Poco Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Poco X5 Pro</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Poco users to bypass FRP on any Poco brand.

In recent days Realme 12 5G has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Realme 12 5G device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Realme 12 5G. It is designed to safeguard the Realme 12 5G device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Realme 12 5G FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Realme-12-5G-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Realme-12-5G-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Realme 12 5G FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Realme 12 5G FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme 12 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Realme 12 5G FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme 12 5G:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Realme 12 5G frp lock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-Realme-12-5G-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Realme-12-5G-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Realme 12 5G FRP?"></a>What is Realme 12 5G FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 12 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 12 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 12 5G device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme 12 5G device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Realme-12-5G-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Realme-12-5G-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Realme 12 5G FRP"></a>Purpose of Realme 12 5G FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Realme 12 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme 12 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme 12 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme 12 5G device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Realme-12-5G-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Realme-12-5G-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Realme 12 5G FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Realme 12 5G FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 12 5G device.
