What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C50 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C50 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C50 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C50-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C50-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco C55 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco C55 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco C55 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C55-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-C55-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Poco F5 Pro 5G smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Poco F5 Pro 5G Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Poco F5 Pro 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Poco F5 Pro 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?"></a>1. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Poco F5 Pro 5G device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Poco F5 Pro 5G phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone -

Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Poco frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Poco X5 Pro device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Poco X5 Pro device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Poco X5 Pro device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Poco X5 Pro device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Poco X5 Pro device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Poco X5 Pro device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass"></a>Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass</h2><p>It is crucial to make sure you’re prepared before you go after the <strong>Poco FRP bypass the Android 13</strong>. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Poco smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Poco before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Poco X5 Pro device. While using your Poco with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Poco-X5-Pro-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Poco-X5-Pro-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Poco X5 Pro device Adequately"></a>Charging the Poco X5 Pro device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Poco device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Poco smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address.

You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Poco X6 .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Poco FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget.

You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Poco X6  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Poco X6 . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Poco X6 , tap “Remove account” once more to verify.

The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don’t remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose “Forget Password.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/bypass-vivo-frp-without-computer-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on forgot password"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Now, use the recovery phone number or email associated with your Google account to receive the verification code.

Once Google has synced the new password across devices, you can sign in and bypass the FRP lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/bypass-vivo-frp-without-computer-2.jpg"                      alt="add the google account details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Using-Third-Party-FRP-Bypass-Apps"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Third-Party-FRP-Bypass-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Third-Party FRP Bypass Apps"></a>Method 2: Using Third-Party FRP Bypass Apps</h3><p>There are many third-party tools available that can help you bypass the Poco X6 Pro FRP lock.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone.

Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme 11 Pro+ Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 11 Pro+ device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 11 Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 11 Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-11-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Realme 11 Pro+ device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Realme 11 Pro+ phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a

Due to Google’s recent Android Security updates, <strong>Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  FRP Bypass</strong> is now extremely tough. FRP is a novel security mechanism implemented in contemporary Android smartphones. To authenticate the valid owner, Android will prompt you to input the last Google account active on the phone before executing the hard reset.</p><p>So, this tutorial is for you if you’ve lost your existing Gmail account and your smartphone is stopped at the Google verification screen. This guide will show you the most recent technique for **Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  FRP Bypass-**Google Account Unlock. So attentively adhere to the simple method outlined below.</p><h2 id="Am-I-able-to-bypass-Realme-FRP"><a href="#Am-I-able-to-bypass-Realme-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Am I able to bypass Realme FRP?"></a>Am I able to bypass Realme FRP?</h2><h3 id="What-is-FRP"><a href="#What-is-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is FRP?"></a>What is FRP?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a safety measure available on Android smartphones. When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.</p><h3 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works?"></a>How it works?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you’ll need your phone’s Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we’ll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.</p><p>FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.</p><p>If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you’re in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.</p><p>Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.</p><p><strong>A simple list of solutions</strong></p><p>To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.</p><ul><li>Retrieve your Google account on another device</li><li>Delete Google account from Settings</li><li>Bypass Realme FRP through PC by using a USB Cable</li></ul><h2 id="Solutions-to-Bypass-Realme-FRP"><a href="#Solutions-to-Bypass-Realme-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Solutions to Bypass Realme FRP?"></a>Solutions to Bypass Realme FRP?</h2><h3 id="Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device"><a href="#Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device" class="headerlink" title="Retrieve your Google account on another device"></a>Retrieve your Google account on another device</h3><p>The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Realme 12 Pro+ 5G .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Realme FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.</p><p><strong>First step:</strong></p><p>To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Realme FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Realme FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Realme C53 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme C53 Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme C53 device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme C53 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme C53 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-C53-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-C53-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?</h3><p>There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Realme C53 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Realme C53 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection"><a href="#2-How-to-Enable-Factory-Reset-Protection" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?"></a>2. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Realme C53 device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Realme C53 phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a
